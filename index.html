         	<p>Kevin Kelly, <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-third-way/">The Third Way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Huge monopolistic companies running platforms like Facebook and Amazon are not mere corporations, nor are they governments, even though they have many of the attributes of both government and corporations. They are a new third thing: platforms. We should not expect to regulate platforms like companies, nor expect them to behave like governments. We need a third category of rights and responsibilities for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Platform-principalities. Bank-states (which, oddly enough, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUduBmvQ_4">includes airlines</a>). Energy-sovereigns (British Petroleum, Exxon). Media-empires (Disney, Universal).</p>

<p>We require a better term for companies that have grown so extraordinarily. Those like Apple that run international diplomacy programs with China. Those like Amazon or Google, that regard their employees as de-facto citizens. Those like airlines that can print a currency (in the form of loyalty programs).</p>

<p>And, as Kelly notes, we should look at them in an entirely different way. We shouldn’t treat Amazon the same we treat a local retailer, just like we don’t treat your local HOA the same way we treat the European Union. “Platforms” is a good start, but a word that connects the tremendous influence modern mega-corps have with the power that Standard Oil or The British Easy India Corporation had at their apex would be even better!</p>

<p><em>Endtroducing</em> is my canonical example of a revealing album. I heard “Building Steam With a Grain of Sand” completely accidentally in a college business writing class, of all places. A fellow student used it in their presentation, ironically. Afterwards, I asked “what <em>was</em> that?!”, my mind still blown.</p>

<p>I downloaded it and was immediately like “wow”. A whole new angle on music became apparent. I was vaguely aware that hip-hop quotes other music, but didn’t really understand sampling. I’m <em>just</em> old enough that hip-hop has always been a thing. But this was so different, like an other-worldly quote-fest. But, in a good way. A great way, even.</p>

<p>I later learned <em>Endtroducing</em> is notable in that it was made <em>manually</em>. Ableton didn’t exist, so if you wanted to change tempos on samples, you had to pitch correct them yourself. You didn’t have to tape splice anymore, thankfully. But it was still far tricker than making this album would have been today.</p>

<p>This album would spark many musical explorations. Mash-ups like <em>A Night at the Hip-Hopera</em>. The Roots, J Dilla, Soulquarians, and a myriad of other artists. “Building Steam With a Grain of Sand” sparked amazement, curiosity, and appetite for more music I was previously unaware of.</p>

<p>These are my favorite of Beethoven’s “more approachable” symphonies. Symphony No. 9 is my favorite, but it requires a bit more context to take in. Further, it’s a solid seventy minutes of music, ramping up the difficulty of attention span.</p>

<p>Symphony No. 7 (hereafter Seven, etc.) is my favorite outside of Nine, which is sort of its own <em>pivotal</em> thing. It’s a definitive no-skip symphony. Every movement is sublime in its own way. The first movement for its vigor and speed. The second for its solemn opening that builds and builds into a big, emotional moment. The third for its frolic. The final movement for feeling several minutes of emphatic, resolving punctuation and resolution.</p>

<p>Symphony No. 8 has a wonderful opening. The structure and melodic quality is closer to what came <em>before</em> Beethoven’s Symphony No. 1. It sounds like a nod back to Haydn or Mozart, Beethoven’s predecessors. But the harmony and orchestration is distinctly of Beethoven. It’s a great bridge from Beethoven’s Very Good symphonies to his <em>Amazing Symphony Number 9, The One with Ode to Joy</em> (not the official title as recognized by music historians).</p>

<p>These two symphonies fit together <em>really well</em> on CDs. So, you can find basically any conductor/ensemble you prefer performing it. I listened to the Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic version when I was playing music in high school. I’ve found this piece easy to hear little variations between conductors, so if that’s your thing, queue up a few interpretations and go hunting for little distinctions!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>There are four-ish kinds of great albums, in my mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pivotal albums: the artist or genre was distinctly different before and after the album came out. e.g., classical music was distinctly different after Beethoven, particularly <em>Symphony No. 9</em></li>
<li>Revealing albums: pivotal to my perspective or knowledge of music. e.g., my understanding of hip-hop was distinctly different after I heard DJ Shadow’s <em>Endtroducing</em></li>
<li>Consistent albums: no track justifies skipping, you can listen to the thing end to end, every time. e.g., Tom Petty’s <em>The Last DJ</em></li>
<li>Under-rated albums: albums that are outshined by their extraordinary peers or contemporaries. Most folks know that <em>Born to Run</em> is great, and all other Springsteen albums (generally) rank below it. But that shouldn’t let otherwise excellent and out-of-sequence later albums like <em>The Rising</em> or <em>Human Touch</em> go unnoticed.</li>

         	<p>Imagine all the busses, boats, monorails, trains, and gondolas in Disney World as (quasi-public) transit system. Then make a transit-style map of said system. It’s fun, but a little dismal once I think about it.</p>

<p>Definitely a top 10 reason (but probably not top 5) I enjoy and find Walt Disney World so intriguing.</p>

<p>Adjacent: if the best transit system many middle/upper-class Americans will experience is a rigorously-top-down, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reedy_Creek_Improvement_District">corporate quasi-state</a>, well, that’s a pretty sick burn on capitalism.</p>

         	<p>I’m kicking off a new “listening project” - Miles Davis. Inspired by <a href="https://samenright.com/2021/06/06/a-beginners-guide-to-miles-davis/">A Beginner’s Guide to Miles Davis</a>, I’m going to grind my way through the Miles-verse in chronological order. For posterity, my favorites from before this journey are <em>Sketches of Spain</em> and <em>Bitches Brew</em>.</p>

<p>(I think <em>Kind of Blue</em> is properly rated but not noteworthy because it’s the jazz album that everyone knows and reveres, whether they like jazz or not. And, rightly so.)</p>

<p>Previously in listening projects:</p>

<p>Circa 2008, I got a little bored/annoyed with what I was listening to and decided to play through all the songs in my iTunes library, in order by artist. Discoveries (to me) lurking therein: Bruce Springsteen <em>Born to Run</em>, Talking Heads, <em>Stop Making Sense</em>. Getting through the B-artists was a real endeavor. I have a <em>lot</em> of Ben Folds, Beethoven, Billy Joel, and Brahms albums.</p>

<p>Circa 2016, I listened to all of the Radiohead albums in chronological order. I’d previously really only known them as “the Creep guys” and “the dudes who released an album of MP3s way before everyone else”. (But probably not before Prince, who also performed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAzzRQe6lms">“Creep”</a>, eventually.)</p>

<p>They’re not particularly useful machines, but they do de-mystify the bridge from electrical engineering to software engineering.</p>

<p>When I was an intern at Texas Instruments, the tools for this were enormously complex, slow, and expensive. Whole clusters of Sun machines set aside for simulating the upcoming designs and verifying they did the right thing in software. Not to mention the tremendous effort of verifying the design that was coded was possible to build in the company’s chip fabrication plants and processes.</p>

<p>That this depth of tooling is now available to hobbyists would have blown me away in 2002.</p>

         	<p>It&rsquo;s hard to land music, books, etc. recommendations from friends because timing is everything. The best case is a recommendation for a thing I didn&rsquo;t know of and it&rsquo;s <em>precisely</em> what I need to read or watch at the exact moment. Beyond that, it&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;m reading some 900-page book (humble-brag) or deep into a peak television series (humble-brag) that I&rsquo;m trying to finish before my attention wanders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come up with a couple of ways to more immediately act on recommendations, so they aren&rsquo;t for naught:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download a Kindle/iBooks sample right away and read the first several pages of whatever they recommended. If I&rsquo;m into it maybe I&rsquo;ll stick with it. At least, it&rsquo;s on my backlog of books until I forgot why it&rsquo;s there and delete it (i.e., 2-3 times a decade).</li>
<li>Watch the first several minutes of the thing on Netflix or whatever. See if it&rsquo;s any good instead of watching random YouTube videos recommended by the algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>For everything else, there&rsquo;s always the long, scary list of things I&rsquo;d read/watch/play/listen to if we stopped doing billionaires and gave everyone a living wage. 🤷‍♂️</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve got three &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; desktops going on my Mac right now. The idea each is its own functional workspace. I don&rsquo;t have three separate physical workspaces to do my writing/thinking, coding/building, or communicating/collaborating. So a digital approximation is the second closest thing. 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>Leftmost is where I do the thinking. The background is one of the &ldquo;scenic&rdquo; images included in macOS. The idea is, if I had a little writing hut, ala <a href="https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/11/06/dickinson/dickinson-thoreau.w700.h467.jpg">Thoreau in <em>Dickinson</em></a> for looking off into the distance and plying some kind of writing craft, this is the kind of thing I would see when I look up.</p>

<p>Rightmost is where I communicate with the world and my colleagues. The background is also a built-in macOS dynamic desktop of swoopy, abstract colors. Like <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oliver-1-1024x576.jpg">John Oliver comes to our living room from a featureless void</a>, so I think of this desktop. Ideas, questions, and data points come to me from the void of the internet, end up in this imagined space, and I respond to them in turn through this medium and back to the void. Heavy, eh?</p>

<p>In the middle is where I do the building and coding. The background here is a flat color. I got it by color picking a photo of the <a href="http://www.12-gaugegarage.com">12-Gauge Garage</a>. I noticed later that it&rsquo;s close to &ldquo;<a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2021/04/disney-go-away-green-lp1/">go away green</a>&rdquo; as used in Disney&rsquo;s theme parks to draw the eye away from backstage areas where the magic may be in-progress or under-repair.

         	<p>Shawn Wang&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.swyx.io/35-principles/">35 Principles for 35 Years</a> are a good read. A few of my favorites:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood. Don&rsquo;t get defensive about your point of view or perception of reality - understand theirs first. Either you will learn something new or you&rsquo;ll understand how to better get your point across. Hold multiple perspectives in your head and be able to summarize the best arguments of all major parties in a way that THEY agree with.</p></li>

<li><p>Don&rsquo;t offer unsolicited help. Make Sure Help Is Wanted Before Offering It. Men - be especially wary about this when women are talking about their problems. Sometimes they just need support, not solutions.</p></li>

<li><p>Separate Your Identity from Your Work. You can learn a lot on the Internet for the low, low price of $YOUR_EGO.</p></li>

        <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2021/03/27/the-long-game.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-03-27 16:10:35 -0600">Mar 27, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>You can do a lot of fancy stuff with your notes these days. Backlinks, graphs, embedding, “transclusion”, knowledge databases, and digital gardens are all tempting sirens. But <strong>building up a collection of ideas over time and ease of search is the most important thing.</strong></p>

<p>Matt Webb, <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2021/02/10/reservoirs">Memexes, mountain lakes, and the serendipity of old ideas</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve noticed that smart people keep notes, and in particular use their notes in a certain way, and it made me think of something I read recently about viruses.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>And it’s interesting, right, this accretive note-taking and the process of taking core samples through the deep time of your own ideas. I’ve built something similar, not as consistently, but for about two decades too, and I keep all my notes in plain text, and all in the same searchable database. I develop nascent ideas in part by typing in keywords, spelunking my own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">memex</a> for things I’ve previously spotted, connections I’ve made, turns of phrase… most of which I had forgotten, but there they are. And old ideas come back and get recombined and become fresh again. That database of notes is my greatest asset. It’s how I write here, and it’s also how I pretend to be clever when I’m working.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The endgame of having extensive notes accumulated over a long period of time is not to put them in a grand, unified theory. <strong>The point is to play the long-game to think in them, search them for new insights, and to develop ideas over weeks and months. An antidote to thinking in Slack messages and tweet-storm hot-takes.</strong></p>

         	<p>A good email newsletter is like the conversation you may have had over coffee with an interesting pal. A surprising topic, a novel theory, perhaps an amusing tangent or two.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m feeling the trough of newsletter overload, like many folks. I&#8217;ve put my own on hiatus because it seems more useful to write broadly on the web than narrowly via email.</p>

<p>I suspect that email newsletters have evolved from interesting conversations to (mostly) yet another medium to build eyeballs to sell to someday. Or, newsletters were the mold that blogging reinvented itself from.</p>

<p>But, I still think good newsletters could still exist. But, they have to feel more like a conversation and less like a monologue.</p>

         	<p>Paul Ford, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-secret-essential-geography-of-the-office/">The Secret, Essential Geography of the Office</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Offices have their own mental maps. “Oh,” they say, “she’s moving to the 17th floor.” And everyone says: the 17th floor! And you know, being a social primate, exactly where you are in the organization relative to that floor. Offices all have their formal and informal maps, whether inside a bank, statehouse, cathedral, museum, school, or open-plan tech firm. I say “West Wing” and you know what I’m talking about. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I once worked at a company where the hypothesis behind customer acquisition was currently in flux. A couple times a quarter, a new concept would come along. With a new concept almost always came a change in the sequencing of handoffs between teams. This month, outside sales hands off to the onboarding team hands off to customer support. The next month, marketing hands off to outside sales hands off to onboarding.</p>

<p>It so happens this company had a large, somewhat raucous open office layout. All of sales, support, and marketing were in one big room. (With three different Sonos systems playing three different songs at any given time. Madness.)</p>

<p>It also so happened that this was a high-energy sales culture. (Are there kinds of sales culture? Someone tell me there are monk-ish sales people, making one call per day, speaking only a few quiet words, ringing a small bell, and going home for the day. 😆)</p>

<p>Thus, when the current concept of how customers were handed off from the top of the funnel downward, a few people would move the desks around so hand-offs happened across aisles of the office and not from one corner of the office to a remote corner sixty feet away.</p>

<p>The upside of all this apparent chaos was that on any given day, you could walk into the office and see the current hypothesis of customer acquisition. As long as you knew who was in sales, marketing, support, etc. or their typical posture (walking around talking on a headset, answering emails as quickly as possible, looking at marketing campaign mockups), you could tell what&#8217;s going on. One could literally walk through the funnel, from marketing to sales to onboarding (assuming that was the hypothesis of the day).</p>

<p>Besides the madness of open offices with multiple songs within speaking distance of each other, I think this is not the worst way to arrange a physical workspace.</p>

It&#8217;s amazing to read the notes of a super-sharp person inventing the foundations of the multi-billion dollar gaming industry as we know it today.</p>

<p>Of course there&#8217;s great technical details, like this bit that should be familiar to anyone who has mysteriously died in an online gaming match:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am reining in the client side prediction to a fairly minimal amount.
It has too many negative effects in different circumstances. The problem
of running away from or in front of your missiles was so bad that I
considered simulating the missiles on the client side, but that is the
second step on a slippery slope. If just the missiles were simulated,
then a missile would fire through an enemy until the server informed
you it exploded on them. Then you consider simulating interactions,
but then you have to guess at other player inputs (which is hopeless)&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darlene Love began her partnership with Spector in 1962, when she came to the attention of Lester Sill, Spector&#8217;s business partner and co-founder of their label Philles Records. In a hurry to record the song &#8220;He&#8217;s a Rebel,&#8221; but unable to cut the song with the vocalists they had under contract, the New York-based group The Crystals, Sill and Spector turned to Love, who lived in Los Angeles. Spector was racing to release his version of the Gene Pitney-penned tune before a version recorded by Vikki Carr could come out and pre-empt his sales. Spector paid Love a flat fee and triple scale to record the song and to allow him to release it under the name The Crystals. The arrangement, made without consulting with The Crystals, was indicative of the power producers had over artists. Describing her experience recording with Spector in her memoir, Love recalled that Spector encouraged what Love calls &#8220;the low, growling side of my voice, the righteous indignation and in-your-face testimony that I usually saved for church.&#8221; Accentuating vocal Blackness in the early 1960s was a daring move in the segregated U.S., but it paid off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw Darlene Love perform, oddly enough, at EPCOT Center. I wonder if they offer musicians a big vacation package for that, of it was just a price-is-right situation?</p>

<p>Between songs, she alluded to having worked with Phil Spector. She basically called him out for the shady behavior described in the NPR story. I&#8217;m guessing it was not for the first time. She concluded the retelling of her history by saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if he hears about me saying this! He&#8217;s in jail, can&#8217;t do anything about it!&#8221; 😆</p>

<p>Wall of Sound is one of my favorite maximalist musical styles and all, but I hope Darlene Love is updating her sick burns on (convicted murderer) Phil Spector to end with &#8220;don&#8217;t matter because he&#8217;s dead now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nostalgia and the “this city used to be cooler” sentiment comes up (and is rejected). Funny that the sentiment in the story is about San Francisco, where many Austinites came from and was allegedly cooler when it had fewer former-San Franciscans.</p>

<p>Maybe cities are like <em>Saturday Night Live</em>: there are very few real stinkers, just casts or episodes or locales for which one isn’t nostalgic.</p>

         	<p>How Product Hunt does asynchronous work: everyone in their own swimlane, unblocked. I really dig how they haven’t siloed work between front-end/back-end developers.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.rstankov.com/collaborative-single-player-mode/">Collaborative Single Player Mode</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A developer should be able to execute a feature from start to finish &ndash; from the database to the backend, API, frontend, and CSS. The goal is never to get blocked.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are missing a design, mock the UI, designers can fill this in later</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t know how to do something technically, hack it or fake it</li>
<li>If a product decision is missing, try to make this decision yourself - it&rsquo;s better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like they use feature flags so they can move quickly and decisively, but safely. And of course, plenty of testing and code review automation.</p>

         	<p>Matt Webb on <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2020/08/27/foundation">Asimov’s Foundation, and what’s unique about science fiction</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like any scientific endeavour it starts as a phenomenological exercise: what’s happening? How does this thing behave in various circumstances? Then beginning to probe: what are its limits? How do we break the premise? And finally consequences… what does it mean for this phenomenon to be wielded deliberately; what are the second order effects when others can see the effects …and so on. Dynamical systems are all the same; the reader can readily draw parallels and discover new truths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing is thinking. Sci-fi, at its best, is thinking about an idea taken to its end. Most sci-fi is a miss, but every once in a while it describes upcoming realities with absolute clarity, e.g. <em>Neuromancer</em>.</p>

         	<p>Let me tell you about my theories on art and fishing. </p>

<p>This Ernest Hemingway story is <em>definitely</em> about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/pursuit-as-happiness">fishing</a>. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I have a theory that most Billy Joel songs are either a) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVlDSzbrH5M">definitely about a fisherman</a> or b) <em>could</em> exist in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCuMWrfXG4E">one world where the protagonist is a fishing professional</a>. Kinda the same thing with Bruce Springsteen song; the whole canon is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc6F47Z6PI4">one working-class world</a>.</p>

<p>Except for songs about cars. Those are a whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuQrVDDSkH4">other</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmN4CNTni3I">thing</a>.</p>

         	<p>Two iOS wishlist items:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any app that can send &amp; receive messages (emails, direct messages, photos, chats, tweets, etc.) should require a narrow, write-only affordance for sending a one-off message without distracting yourself in all the engagement loops.</li>
<li>&#8220;Smoke-break&#8221;, an extension of the current screen time affordance. Only allow yourself access to e.g. Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc. for seven minutes of the hour. The easy part is integrating this into the operating system. The hard and most impactful part is keeping the Smoke-break name and all its negative connotations.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way to achieve these outcomes now is to <strong>delete the app</strong> from your device and only dip into the web interface when you absolutely must. That&#8217;s contrary to Apple&#8217;s goals. It&#8217;s not bad for the web platform, though🤔.</p>

<p>In short: nerf the engagement loops at the operating system level. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you build teams around projects, this means that there is a ramp-up period while the team go through the early stages, and if the team is not together for long enough, it’s possible they won’t spend very long (if any time at all) in the performing stage. This happens if new initiatives come in and the team is disbanded to form other, new teams.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of effort to form a team; you need to find the right balance of skills, someone to tech lead, delivery manage and be the product owner; you need to find engineers, customer researchers, product designers and possibly business analysts and you need to make sure that the work they are currently doing can be finished or stopped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specialization and matrix&#8217;d teams seem inevitable as an organization grows. I suspect that a cross-functional, self-sufficient team that has time together and knows how to work together will almost always outperform teams of specialists spread across multiple projects and priorities.</p>

<p>The jury&#8217;s still out on how this compares to a written memo culture. But, a marginal benefit of a video memo is you can watch it at greater than 1x speed and feel like you&#8217;re getting more out of your time! 💪</p>

<blockquote>
<p>America’s egotistical bent doesn’t mean we lack a conscience: we carry around a ton of guilt, as part of the cost of letting egos run wild the way we do. The narrative of “the coastal elites want to tell you what to feel guilty about; we won’t let them” is effective for a reason: because we are collectively guilty of so many things, from climate change to police brutality and everything else. The Trump candidacy figured out how to exploit this better than anyone else: in a complex and interdependent world, everyone is basically guilty of everything. And when that’s true, no one can say “you should feel guilt” without sounding hypocritical. It’s a perfect judo move, because not only does it neutralize the superego’s ability to effectively level any criticism, it opens the door for the ego to go be as offensive as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The de-centralization of timekeeping brought about by digital media harkens back to a much older style of measuring time. Before the invention of the telegraph, there was no way to instantaneously synchronize timekeeping devices across long distances. No time zones, no universal standard against which clock towers could be evaluated for accuracy. Timekeeping was more an art than a science. Each village emitted its own time zone. Much like the townships of old, every internet community has its own “subjective time zone”.</p>

<p>The disruption of the old timekeeping regime created a void that’s being filled by new online communities, cliques, and cults. Whereas the industrial schedule provided a sense of structure and stability and continuity, D.I.Y. timekeeping often feels aimless and disorienting and uncertain. People are seeking out groups and ideologies that put them “back in time”, and many internet subcultures do exactly that.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://untools.co/">Untools</a> is a collection of mental models for thinking about problems, projects, and ideas. For example, the latest tool, the <a href="https://untools.co/cynefin-framework">Cynefin framework</a> is useful for assessing the kind of problem you face (complex, complicated, chaotic, or obvious) to determine what kind of strategy is appropriate for tackling it. Makes for a handy afternoon research dive.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something interesting about Untools as website. Under the hood, there&#8217;s not much to it; you could implement it with a static site generator. By that measure, I might describe this as a &#8220;brochure&#8221; site. But the attention to design and organization makes it feel much more like a product. Delightfully, one that doesn&#8217;t seek a commercial transaction. More like flipping someone&#8217;s personal but well-organized notes on conceptual tools. Feels novel, in an obvious way.</p>

<p>For most of “Starship Troopers,” humanity, in every possible facet, gets its ass kicked. A culture that reveres and communicates exclusively through violence—a culture very much like one that responds to peaceful protests with indiscriminate police brutality, or whose pandemic strategy is to “dominate” an unreasoning virus—keeps running up against its own self-imposed limitations.</p>

<p>The pandemic that has dominated the past three months strikes a useful contrast with what’s happening now. Unlike coronavirus, racism and police violence are problems caused by humans. There’s a saying, “You aren’t stuck in traffic, you are traffic.” Similarly, the unrest occurring right now isn’t something that is happening to anyone, but a phenomenon that everyone is a part of, even if they haven’t left home or directly participated at all. Like traffic, the reason you’re surrounded by protests is partially because of you, regardless of your perceived level of involvement.</p>

         	<p>Bonus quote from <a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/eno/">Revenge of the Intuitive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Years ago I realized that the recording studio was becoming a musical instrument. I even lectured about it, proclaiming that “by turning sound into malleable material, studios invite you to construct new worlds of sounds as painters construct worlds of form and color.” I was thrilled at how people were using studios to make music that otherwise simply could not exist. Studios opened up possibilities. But now I’m struck by the insidious, computer-driven tendency to take things out of the domain of muscular activity and put them into the domain of mental activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am, in general, a sucker for the notion of the studio as a kind of musical instrument unto itself. It&rsquo;s a very maximalist, Romantic-era symphony sort of thinking. I want to be <em>Pet Sounds</em>-era Brian Wilson or <em>Rite of Spring</em>-era Stravinksy when I grow up.</p>

         	<p>We should use the pandemic to reevaluate how we value service, child care, and education labor. It’s apparent we undervalued them. Their value is now explicit for those clamoring for a return to paying people to handle their chores and obligations. So let’s pay them more when we emerge from this!</p>

<p>The burden of navigating urban sprawl to reach our offices, shops, and entertainment is now explicit. Density won’t be the answer for this is in the short or medium term. Perhaps we could value the ease by which we can drive around right now and work backwards from there.</p>

<p>The bit that has worried me is how density is no longer a virtue. Public transport and dense neighborhoods won’t be desirable for a while. What’s the alternative that reduces our environmental toll and increases the cohesion of our neighborhoods?</p>

<p>You could also think about the Apple Watch as the main input device. In contrast to the AirPods, Apple opened the Watch for developers from the start, but it hasn’t really seen much success as a platform.

         	<p>Drew Austin on high/low-brow music, how it fits into album reviews and club culture, and how all that has shifted in our current state of distance. <a href="https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/122-energy-flash">Energy Flash</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For Reynolds, “at home and at album length” refers to a process of decontextualization, the musical equivalent of the modern gallery’s white cube: a belief that any cultural product meriting serious appreciation must prove that it can survive outside of its native habitat by becoming a fungible unit of culture, fitting into the standardized format of Pitchfork album reviews and solitary, focused listening. If music sounds good in a packed nightclub at 3 a.m. but not through headphones on your couch, is it real in the same way that Kid A is real? Right now in quarantine, the contextualizing environments in which culture traditionally incubates are closed off and dormant, so everything has to sound good in the living room whether it’s meant to or not. We live in the white cube now; anything that relies on a specific source of external context is an endangered species. We’re one month into a worldwide experiment to learn whether the internet alone can produce sufficient meaning on its own, or whether we must keep mining our memories of an embodied shared reality to bridge this gap.”</p>

<p>The aerospace giant of course wants a $60 billion bailout. Financial problems for this corporation predated the crisis, with the mismanagement that led to the 737 Max as well as defense and space products that don&rsquo;t work (I noted last July a bailout was coming). The corporation paid out $65 billion in stock buybacks and dividends over the last ten years, and it was drawing down credit lines before this crisis hit. It is highly politically connected; the board of the corporation includes Caroline Kennedy, Ronald Reagan’s Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein, three Fortune 100 CEOs, a former US Trade Representative, and two Admirals, one of whom is the board’s only engineer. Using the excuse of the coronavirus, Boeing is trying to get the taxpayer to foot the bill for its errors, so it can go back to making more of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have locality when you don&rsquo;t have to look beyond your gaze to understand how you are affected or how you affect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find languages with a strong module system (Rust, Clojure, sometimes ES6-by-the-books) make each source file more coherent and easier to read than languages where methods or state have more sophisticated/powerful lookup schemes (Ruby, React-flavored ES6).</p>

<p>Plus, strong module systems seem to come with the side benefit of encouraging us to make up names for the functions and state we import, again improving coherence and readability.</p>

<p>A strong sense of locality, module systems, and coherence aren&rsquo;t in a causal relationship, but they sure do taste great together.</p>

Kent Beck underscores that depth in listing all [the desirable qualities of good tests], some of which are at tension with each other. Tests aren’t the easiest thing to get right, but there’s no better way to improve your design skills than to wrestle with the feedback loop of writing tests for the code you’re currently working on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Tetlock’s 20-year study, both the broad foxes and the narrow hedgehogs were quick to let a successful prediction reinforce their beliefs. But when an outcome took them by surprise, foxes were much more likely to adjust their ideas. Hedgehogs barely budged. Some made authoritative predictions that turned out to be wildly wrong—then updated their theories in the wrong direction. They became even more convinced of the original beliefs that had led them astray. The best forecasters, by contrast, view their own ideas as hypotheses in need of testing. If they make a bet and lose, they embrace the logic of a loss just as they would the reinforcement of a win. This is called, in a word, learning.</p>

         	<p>Stephen Anderson on <a href="https://medium.com/@stephenanderson/the-future-of-design-computation-complexity-a434d2da3cd5">The Future of Design: Computation &amp; Complexity</a>. Like everything else, its going to get more weird. But, the large-scale outcome remains the same - design is deciding which elements are essential and which elements to remove:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real world isn’t so simple, and often has many competing goals and constraints. As a designer, what are you already doing, to help define the objectives and goals for a project? As critical as this is to teamwork, it’s the single, driving factor for machines. We can — and should — absolutely lean into defining these things. This has always been important, but will be vital as we hand over more decisions to Machine Learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definitely sounds like the future…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, what if I told you nothing could be designed that can’t be pitched, coded up, and released in an afternoon. Sound insane? I know of at least one company — the largest in their industry — that works this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…and we have to invent a future where we solve this future we created without thinking through the ramifications:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never before has technology allowed individuals to do more harm (or good) with such low effort.
— Christian Beck</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​Any practice where we can drive the iteration time to zero will end up requiring a new way of working where the computer generates a bunch of possible designs/systems/artifacts and a human applies education and intuition to determine which one to keep:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Play this out, and the role of human shifts from that of hands-on creator using software to render an idea to that of a conductor (or curator or cultivator?) working with software to explore possible options. In a sense, we develop a sort of symbiotic relationship with the machine; the machine generates possibilities that we then direct or tweak until arriving at an optimal solution. We see this playing out in nearly every industry, from manufacturing to the design of web sites to healthcare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​A phase transition has already happened where the most successful systems occasionally touch the lives of city-sized populations. “Scale” means the most successful systems/platforms touch entire societies and a major fraction of the human population. I missed this forest amongst the trees of frameworks, languages, and databases. I suspect leaders like Zuckerberg and Dorsey missed it amongst the trees of growth and market acquisition.</p>

<p>Again, we have to invent a future where we fix the future we accidentally created:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is new in all this is visibility into the scale and scope of problems we now work on — we have to ask questions about impact and outcomes. Facebook and Twitter are platforms that have changed the world. The addictive properties of Pinterest and SnapChat are changing human behavior and social interactions. We can’t treat these things like simple web apps. They aren’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of inventing the future to fix the future is thinking more about feedback loops and how small changes in forces and incentives create outsized results:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Much of the literature on formal systems thinking is dedicated to this topic of small changes. Reinforcing loops and balancing loops are the two foundational structures of systems thinking. The idea goes like this: Want to introduce a change? Don’t try to change the system (you can’t!). Instead, introduce a small change, or tweak an existing rule, then see what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More optimiscally, this last bit leads me to (continue to) think that the skills designers need aren’t so far off the skills developers need:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve identified about 11 ways of being that describe design. I won’t go into them all — there’s a post coming for that. But you’ve heard me mention some of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frame &amp; Reframe Problems</li>

         	<p>A thing I want to try is coding offline, per se. Without a functional computer (like a tablet). Think first. Outline and sketch a solution. Maybe pseudocode it up. Then fill it in and make it work once a “real” computer is available.</p>

<p>Related: think first, outline/sketch a solution, only use the computer once I’m ready to build.</p>

<p>Related related: what if frameworks like Rails, Django, etc. are scaffolds that we attach boilerplate-ish behavior to while we’re trying to figure what a program <em>really</em> wants to be? How many essay-sized programs are hiding in novel or encyclopedia-sized systems?</p>

<p>Basically: I want to code without computers more often, and discover more program designs that are lurking within the design of a framework.</p>

         	<p>I’m attempting to learn Rust. And really make it stick this time around. A lot of the “making it stick” part is making lists and having the discipline to stick with crossing items off them!</p>

<p>A smaller part is figuring out how I can notch very small victories no matter how much progress I make. This is crucial because I’ve got about a half an hour each morning to work on this!</p>

<p>My current favorite sort of small victory is to write up what I’ve learned if it doesn’t seem like I’m going to get far enough to commit new code behavior. This happens a fair bit when you’re working with a type checker after years of using a very implicit language.</p>

<p>So far I’ve written up what I’ve learned about the web frameworks <a href="https://github.com/therealadam/rust-web-bakeoff/blob/master/docs/actix.md">Nickel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/therealadam/rust-web-bakeoff/blob/master/docs/actix.md">Actix</a> so far.</p>

         	<p>A couple things making me feel more productive lately:</p>

<p><strong>Jot down a theme for the day</strong>: at the beginning or end of the day, I make up some kind of near-platitude to help me focus and get stuff done. Recently: “Hack like a writer”, “Finish like a shipper”, “Focus on code”. They&rsquo;re a bit hustle-y, nearly cringe-y, and function only to get me back on track should I field a bunch of curveballs.</p>

<p><strong>“Sync&rdquo; written notes to a daily page</strong>: usually after lunch and before I wrap up work for the day, I transcribe any notes/sketches/todos/etc. I wrote down, on pen and paper, to a note (in <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a>). This seems to help me keep a clear head and not get overwhelmed on hectic days.</p>

<p>A couple things that feel right but haven&rsquo;t &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; as habits yet:</p>

<p><strong>Set out clothes for tomorrow before I go to bed</strong>: check the weather, set out what I&rsquo;ll wear tomorrow. I often forget, but when I don&rsquo;t I thank myself the next day.</p>

<p><strong>One big thing, a dozen or so little things</strong>: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll go so far as eschewing a productivity/todo app, but using <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/one-thing/">One Thing</a> as a guideline when organizing my tasks often helps me reduce implausible lists to tractable plans.</p>

         	<p>Ruby library designs based on plugins and/or extensive module composition make me worried I’m going to spend a lot of time understanding the flow of control between modules (e.g. CarrierWave, AuthLogic).</p>

<p>I’d rather something that’s already integrated with “common” problems of coupling. I have a lot more experience troubleshooting those and don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;play computer&rdquo; so much. 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>Presumably he was out promoting <em>The Rising</em>, a sincere collection of 9/11 songs. Nonetheless, I guess he decided it was a good time to educate the kids about their rock and roll heritage.</p>

         	<p>Pitchfork: <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talking-heads-remain-in-light/?mbid=social_twitter">Talking Head: <em>Remain in Light</em></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>By 1980, the conflict in music between what was thought and what was felt was in full cry. As disco continued to monopolize music you could dance to, rock reached a point of maximum theoretical sincerity. Pink Floyd’s The Wall, possibly the least ironic recording of all time, was the No. 1 album in America for 15 weeks. It was finally unseated by Bob Seger’s Against the Wind, which was knocked out of the top spot by Billy Joel’s Glass Houses. Ostensibly, these were works of deep sentiment. To a generation of punks, though, they were rock at its most bloodless and calculating.
&hellip;
The central insight of Talking Heads—what made them not just weird but exciting and relevant—was that their art-house affectation felt more sincere than a lot of American culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely unrelated but somewhat adjacent: the unseen magic trick Bruce Springsteen pulls off, for me, is to thread the needle between sincere storytelling, grandiose maximalism, and bar band raucousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without Afrobeat, though, there is no Remain in Light. The central role of West-African polyrhythms in the album’s sound draws attention to a curious aspect of its longevity. Could a group of white musicians playing Afrobeat be taken sincerely in 2018? Virtually every genre of American music, including punk and especially rock, is taken from black forms. Afrobeat is not African-American, though; it’s straight-up African. The 21st-century sensibility finds something problematic in a band of white art-school types playing West African music. Earlier this year, the Beninese musician Angelique Kidjo released her own version of Remain in Light, which NPR described as “an authentic Afrobeat record” compared to the original. Given how closely Kidjo followed the Talking Heads’ arrangements, this description raises questions about what we mean when we say “authentic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great review and a pretty good read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unanticipated but important memo has a difficult road. It will likely be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this is one of the unexpected challenges of taking on engineering leadership responsibilities. First off, you have to do all the writing things right: use a clear and concise subject, say all the important things up front (probably in bullets!), and develop the important details in thoughtful prose. Even if you nail it there, some people just won&rsquo;t read, retain, and/or care about the information you have conveyed to them.</p>

<p>Hence: Always Be Repeating Yourself. Always.</p>
