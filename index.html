<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about the search box versus the feed,” he said. “Let’s take Twitter. When I open it, everybody wants me to think about something.</p>

<p>A Ponzi ecosystem of hustle, reality distortion and projection, outright misinformation and propaganda. Plus, folks who just want to tell you the world is miserable. On the other hand, some funny takes and the occasional wholesome content. As goes social media, so goes humanity.</p>
<p>That bit of (attempted) gallows humor aside, the linked article has a good angle: search for more information and do <em>actual research</em> rather than letting algorithmic-people filter it towards you. Caveat: this may have been more useful when that post was written in 2019 than it is in the reality of junky internet search that is 2024.</p>

			 <p>Virtuosity and speed are nice, in music and life. But you leave some space between the notes or slow things <em>way</em> down? Make some space in between the music for the <em>music</em> to happen? Now you’re cooking something good. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aretha Franklin, the greatest of all time at making the most of the space between notes. As I’m fond of saying: there is no song Aretha Franklin could not perform slower <em>and</em> better than anyone else. Compare the tempo of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BDw-H_hUzw">Otis Redding’s <em>Respect</em></a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Itb17PXvw">Aretha’s version</a>, both recorded in the same year.</li>
<li>AC/DC, “Back In Black” or “Highway To Hell”. This is where I’d start rock and roll songwriting 101.</li>
<li>D’Angelo, “Untitled (How Does It Feel?)”. Most of his work is an exemplar, he’s a master of making songs feel <em>spacious</em>.</li>
<li>Joe Cocker, “With A Little Help From My Friends”. Take a jaunty, mid-tier Beatles song and draw it <em>way</em> out. This makes room for the huge, stacked vocals chorus. Suddenly, it’s right in the feels.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Funk is unique amongst musical genres, in my perspective, due to the importance of the notes <em>you don’t play</em>. The <em>space</em> between notes, and not “shredding” every possible moment, is important in all genres. But I find that the funkiest stuff gets that way from missing expected notes and shifting expected notes to moments where they shouldn’t be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funk was a rhythmic system of tension and release over time, but also simultaneous tension between some players exercising maximum restraint and others exhibiting maximum expressiveness. Most of all, funk was a science of subverted expectations, syncopation taken to its ultimate destination. With funk, things weren’t always where you thought they’d be.</p>

			 <p>I have an elaborate, perhaps baroque, setup of journals, notes, tasks, highlights, read-it-laters, feeds, and canvases-for-thinking. I consider it a crucial, and very idiosyncratic, piece of “knowledge worker infrastructure”. Furthermore, I don’t think I could handle a lot of the work and projects that I do, to the extent that I do, without it.</p>
<p>But, I hope that constructing such a scheme, and doing all the time intensive background research and tinkering, is not something <em>everyone</em> would have to expend effort on to think better and more clearly.</p>
<p>My hunch here is that the software bundled with iOS/iPadOS/macOS is <em>very close</em> to allowing folks who just want to remember and brainstorm get started <em>immediately</em>. Currently, a couple of elements are missing. This means you have to hit the third-party ecosystem escape hatch and consider a <em>daunting</em> variety of applications, workflows, and identity/quasi-religions.</p>
<p>Herein, a wishlist of system-level capabilities that would make macOS an even better “bicycle for the mind”.</p>
<hr>
<p>In any old macOS app, I want to highlight text (mostly) with any pointer (mouse, stylus, finger) on any device (laptop, tablet, phone) and capture/promote text. I may want to add my commentary or notes too. Afterward, I should be able to search for this in Spotlight, at the least. Even better if the whole document/page/file/etc. the text came from is indexed, so I can find highlights despite imperfect memory.</p>
<p>macOS already extracts contacts and events from plain text. Faces are identified in photos. Why not make text excerpts/highlights/passages a first-class thing in the system’s information architecture?</p>
<hr>
<p>I want to identify key ideas, concepts, people, and other nouns, so I can hyperlink between them <em>and</em> navigate them in <em>something</em> like the Finder.</p>
<p>This verbs-and-nouns concept was key to AppleScript. I’ve read that it was part of the conceptual bedrock of NeXTStep, but I haven’t found more than a few passing sentences on that.</p>
<p>Why not carry that idea forward or rediscover it on macOS? Some folks want to do more than scroll, post, and transact.</p>
<hr>
<p>Notes and Journal, along with Finder and Spotlight, seem <em>very close</em> to checking all the boxes here. 🤷🏻‍♂️I don’t use those apps, so I’m wildly speculating here. Out over my skis, as they say. That said, this is <em>so close</em> to the core of what you really need to do next-level, thinking-augmented-by-computers.</p>
<p>Even though I use very particular apps, I feel like Apple has the right foundations here. A journal app for capturing ideas, reflections, and life as it happens. A notes app for putting structure and organization around the ideas that emerge from those moments. Tie it together with search to resurface and rediscover those journals and notes.</p>
<p>A fellow can dream, right?</p>

<p><a href="https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-7">iA Writer</a>’s integration is the first use of LLMs I’ve seen that I’d consider original. They didn’t slap on a chat interface where one wasn’t needed. It’s not autocomplete-but-smarter.</p>
<p>Instead, they show authorship/origin of text as either human or machine-generated. As you edit out the AI machine’s writing, the text visually and literally becomes more your own creation. You engage in dialog with the machine and use that to <em>improve</em> your thinking. The machine doesn’t think for you. Bravo!</p>

			 <p>Oliver Burkeman, <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/river">Treat your to-read pile like a river</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To return to information overload: this means treating your &ldquo;to read&rdquo; pile like a river (a stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that you empty it). After all, you presumably don&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library – and not because there aren&rsquo;t an overwhelming number of them, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.</p>
<p>I like to think of it as the productivity technique to beat all productivity techniques: finally internalizing the implications of the fact that what&rsquo;s genuinely impossible – the clue is in the name! – cannot actually be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You cannot actually read, process, and comment upon the whole internet, or even your little corner of interesting discourse. But, you can click “Mark All As Read” and move on. River-of-news style timelines automate marking items unread instead of automating bringing you the good stuff. <a href="https://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> and <a href="https://www.newsblur.com/">NewsBlur</a> have options for it. I bet others do too. <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/09/28/rewinding-your-attention/">Reclaim your attention</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, most advice on productivity and time management takes the needle-in-a-haystack approach instead. It&rsquo;s about becoming more efficient and organised, or better at prioritising, with the implied promise that you might thereby eliminate or disregard enough of life&rsquo;s unimportant nonsense to make time for the meaningful stuff. To stretch a metaphor: it&rsquo;s about reducing the size of the haystack, to make it easier to focus on the needle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a role for such techniques; but in the end, the only way to deal with a too-many-needles problem is to confront the fact that it&rsquo;s insoluble – that you definitely won&rsquo;t be fitting everything in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a question of rearranging your to-do list so as to make space for all your &ldquo;big rocks&rdquo;, but of accepting that there are simply too many rocks to fit in the jar. You have to take a stab at deciding what matters most, among your various creative passions/life goals/responsibilities – and then do that, while acknowledging that you&rsquo;ll inevitably be neglecting many other things that matter too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m guilty here! All the best in task management, getting things done, note-taking, journal writing, and even <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/11/01/saying-no-is.html">saying no</a> won’t get the work done. I have to take the gift of clarity and focus generated by all these routines, and <em>do that “big rock” important thing</em>. I have to find peace with the trade-off of doing one thing instead of all the other exciting things.</p>
<p>Or, maybe <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/11/16/smaller-barriers-to.html">generative AIs</a> will provide Walt Disney-like agency to direct and sustain diverse projects outside my expertise with Imagineering-quality output. Wouldn’t it be nice!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In chess, which for decades now has been dominated by A.I., a player’s only hope is pairing up with a bot. Such half-human, half-A.I. teams, known as centaurs, might still be able to beat the best humans and the best A.I. engines working alone. Programming has not yet gone the way of chess. But the centaurs have arrived. GPT-4 on its own is, for the moment, a worse programmer than I am. Ben is much worse. But Ben plus GPT-4 is a dangerous thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/14/a-coder-considers-the-waning-days-of-the-craft/">Simon Willison on the same</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think AI assisted programming is going to shave a lot of the frustration off learning to code, which I hope brings many more people into the fold</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve entered the age of AI-powered coding, writing, speaking, and painting centaurs.</p>
<p>If we play our cards right, we will lower barriers to entry <em>and</em> raise the ceiling of possibility to new levels. If more people can <em>create</em> in mediums that are considered specializations now, that <em>might</em> open allow experts to go deeper in their specialization or branch out into areas that were inaccessible without compromising their specialization.</p>
<p>The idea of a dilettante, a person who cultivates an area of interest, such as the arts, without real commitment or knowledge, might become acute or obsolete. We might end up with a new level of “yuck that looks some amateurish and <em>generated</em>”. Or we might end up with reviews like “the artist deftly combines generated and hand-drawn sketches with procedurally generated music modeled on their own previous album <em>I Play Pianos, By Hand, Like Duke Did</em>”.</p>
<p>Of course, we’ve heard this story before and famed economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes">Keynes</a> is (infamous?) for predicting mechanical automation would all have us exploring our favorite hobbies at this point. So, we gotta play our cards right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As part of that, I made the difficult decision to call my publisher to push my next book a year or so. This was a massive clearance on my schedule—several hours a day did not have to be spent researching and writing on a project. Yet it was remarkable how little my life changed. Because tasks expand to fill the space, because it is so easy to say yes to other things. <em>Less</em> demands vigilance and discipline, perhaps even more effort than actually doing stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reward for saying no feels like saying yes to a more important thing. But you still need decision discipline after that first “no”.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;ve heard things like &ldquo;the key to serene focus and productivity is saying no more often&rdquo;, it often seems like saying &ldquo;no, thanks&rdquo; on projects and potential work is the top of the hill. Like it&rsquo;s all downhill to doing great work from there. Say no, they say, puts you on easy street to writing the great American novel/album/YouTube channel/large language model.</p>
<p>Alas, saying no is not one weird trick for exercising all of your decision-making and discipline in one crucial moment. Making great stuff requires many small moments of saying no. Say no to looking up that frivolous fact. Say no to the pull of social media. Say no to taking a day off your habit of making great stuff. Say no to that Oreo cookie. ☹️</p>

			 <p>George Saunders on <a href="https://georgesaunders.substack.com/p/office-hours-8e8">getting past self-critical/low-energy writing spirals</a> (aka one of the many forms of writer’s block):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another thing I sometimes suggest is this: stop writing. That is, stop doing your “real” writing. Yank yourself out of your usual daily routine. Instead, today, off the top of your head, write one sentence. Don’t think about what it should be about, or any of that. Just slap some crazy stuff down on the page. (Or it can be sane stuff. The “slapping down” is the key.) Print it out. Then, go do something else and, over the next 24 hours, do your best not to give that sentence a single thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complete method, in my own words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a sentence, nothing in particular. Just start.</li>
<li>Return to that sentence daily, making additions or changes that feel right.</li>
<li>As the thing grows from a sentence to a paragraph and so on, spend more time with it. But don&rsquo;t sweat the magnitude of the output. A trivial punctuation change is &ldquo;a good day&rsquo;s work&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Get bolder in the changes. Do what you prefer and don&rsquo;t worry about why it is you gravitate towards that particular change.</li>
<li>Resist the urge to switch from working on an exercise to working your routine/process. Keep growing it instinctively.</li>
<li>Eventually you have a whole story/essay/whatever written this way and you&rsquo;re happy to do something with it.</li>
<li>Now you are un-stuck.</li>

			 <p>I’m reflecting<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> on travelogue’ing my <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/07/30/rule-is-you.html">recent</a> <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/07/31/rule-is-you.html">trip</a> <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/08/01/wherein-favorite-franchises.html">to</a> <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2023/08/02/many-parts-of.html">Disneyland</a>. In particular, that it was effective at taking my mind off work while maintaining creative writing and publishing habits.</p>
<p>Lately, I find myself dwelling on work too much or noodling through various puzzles I’m trying to solve. I would rather not bring that with me on vacation. What I removed and what I replaced those thoughts with went pretty well! For my own memory, and perhaps dear reader’s benefit:</p>
<p><strong>Allow plenty of moments to just exist</strong>. Listen, enjoy where you are. Engage with the folks you’re vacationing with, presuming they’re not in a phone-bubble. Try to put the phone away after you mindlessly open it out of boredom. Cultivate the moments of boredom, if you can.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t look at feeds</strong> like Slack, Discord, socials, etc. I took the extra step of removing Slack from my phone entirely. It’s easier to remove it entirely and re-add each Slack later than to try to ignore particular instances whenever I find myself mindlessly opening the app. Read a lot, ideally longer form things chosen beforehand. Again: ignore the feeds of people hustling or trying to get their ideas into my attention. Think your own thoughts!</p>
<p><strong>Replace all those feeds and work-think with written and photographic journaling.</strong> Look for photography opportunities, even if you’re not particularly good at it (yet). Write in a journal, daily, even if you’re not good at it (yet). Write about what you’ve photographed, about whatever you’re thinking while disconnected, about that conversation you just had or the novel thing you just saw/did.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to share via social networks, do it once a day.</strong> I posted (via micro.blog and <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>) a short reflection on each day. For texture, I included a quad of photos, and wrote a few sentences to reflect on my photography or day so far. Once the post is made, put the computer away and get back to reveling in disconnection.</p>
<p>YMMV, but I hope you try it!</p>

<p>Particularly at dusk and night, and for folks (like me) with very rudimentary photography skills. I’m pretty convinced this is one of the myriad details the Imagineers wrangle as they design these parks.</p>

<p>One of our favorites is the Animation Academy. It’s a short entertainment, wherein a cast member teaches you to draw a Disney/Pixar character in ten minutes or so. I’m not at all good at sketching, so I think it speaks volumes to the quality of the cast members that you can, maybe, tell that I’m drawing Mickey Mouse here.</p>

<p>Yet, it remains to be seen to what extent AI will yield entirely new media, modalities, and consumption levels or if it will merely modify technology we’re already familiar with.</p>
<p>Is generative AI the iPhone (entirely new media/modality/consumption), the iPhone camera (displaces <em>and exceeds</em> existing categories), or the ability to scan QR codes with your camera to reduce transactional friction (a game changer for some that quickly fades into the background)?</p>

			 <p>Whenever I find myself wishing I was posting more toots/articles/etc., I remind myself that the first step is to get words out of my head and onto the page.

			 <p>I’m <a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2022/11/09/currently-digging.html">still</a> reading about the Manhattan Project. The going is slow. Big books, big timelines. At least, for the speed at which I read.</p>
<p>Rhodes, <em>Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> – I’m 500+ pages in and only up to the early 1940s. That’s a hefty history meatball. That said, it’s a deep dive into the history of science in context with chemistry and quantum/nuclear physics. If you like a hefty but complete book, this one is your jam.</p>
<p>Wellerstein, <em>Restricted Data</em> – I have very much enjoyed the author’s <a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com">blog of the same name</a> over the years. The author goes deep on the newly created apparatus for keeping the Manhattan Project secret from very nearly the whole world during the war. The pace for this one is a little off, to my preference, so I’ve put this one down for the moment.</p>
<p>Gleick, <em>Genius</em> – Big Richard Feynman fan here. This book does not disappoint as a biography. Gleick is a great writer, writing with detail but without losing pace or going so deep that the thread is easily lost.</p>
<p>Reading in <a href="https://www.driverlesscrocodile.com/books-and-recommendations/more-from-tyler-cowen-and-russ-roberts-on-reading/">topical clusters</a> has worked really well for me. The books <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/02/13/on-reading-more-than-one-book-at-a-time/">talk to each</a> other. It’s a bit like a Manhattan Project Cinematic Universe when personalities come together in Los Alamos and then disperse as each book follows a different thread of history. Physicists assemble, I suppose!</p>

<p>On minor funks, needing a reset, and indeed doing nothing.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Reset</strong>. Occasionally, the things I do stop <em>doing</em> it for me. Games, shows, books, magazines, etc. I pick them up and realize I’m bored with all of them. I require a break from my breaks.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, taking a vacation or extended weekend with too little purpose <em>or</em> purpose too close to routine seems to generate the same response.</p>
<p><strong>The Reset</strong> almost always involves going offline, to some extent. Not like <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/150/">Craig Mod hiking</a> <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/116/">through rural Japan</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It sometimes involves catching up on chores, tidying up the house, or <em>extremely</em> low-key home improvement<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Related: YouTube could use a function for this. “All my subscriptions &amp; recommendations aren’t doing it, we need to go weirder/normal-er”.</p>
<p>Doing <em>absolutely</em> nothing is an option, but ends up feeling a little more hollow than free-ing.</p>
<p>More often, rebelling against my routines and script-following tendencies works. Binge-watching, grinding a game, ignoring diet, etc. sometimes get me clear.</p>
<hr>
<p>The trickiest bit is when I’m in <strong>An Indefinite Funk</strong>. Hobbies seem shallow or meant to impress others or not fulfilling anymore or too much like work or too expensive/intensive to maintain.</p>
<p>So far, I don’t have a great antidote for that. Last time it happened to me, I reverted two decades to making music, decided it still wasn’t <em>for</em> me, and went back to enjoying and sometimes studying/pontificating on music.</p>
<p>Going offline is in some ways a luxurious and nice way to reset. We so rarely allow ourselves a moment or location of offline-ness. If you have to book a flight or <a href="https://www.996roadtrip.com">outfit your Porsche 911 for camping</a>, so be it. It’s fine to just put your online devices in another room, too.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Recommended</em>: do yourself an <strong>Ideal Weekend</strong> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get coffee</li>
<li>Go for a walk in a nice park</li>
<li>Take a nap</li>
<li>Read a book</li>
<li>Go for a swim</li>
<li>Stroll through the vibrant part of your town</li>
</ul>
<p>Any weekend that includes most of those is likely to give me a reset such that any funk that is imminent or currently occurring goes away.</p>

			 <p>A few years ago, I set up a Mastodon account on a now-defunct instance. It didn’t scare me away, is kinda neat in some ways, the Bird has gone chaotic, and so I’m at it again. Like many folks the past few days, I’m setting up a Mastodon presence mostly from scratch.</p>
<p>If you’re on the fence about Mastodon, here’s how to speed-run it:</p>
<ul>
<li>skim <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/5/mastodon/">Simon Willison’s post</a> and follow as many links as you like</li>
<li>find an instance (i.e. a community/<a href="https://twitter.com/garius/status/1588827788261601280">home-room</a>) that suits you and join it</li>
<li>use <a href="https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/">Debirdify</a> to find and follow folks who have advertised a Mastodon presence</li>
<li>start posting to Mastodon; ideally, get as weird as your web presence was before global social networks were a thing</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings my web presence to at least four interesting locales. Which raises the question, “hey Adam, why do you have so many websites”. Herein, I will answer that with the question they’re intended to answer 🧠 👴🏻:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://therealadam.com">My original-ish blog</a> (<a href="https://therealadam.com/feed/">RSS</a>), answering “hey Adam, what are you thinking about or building?”</li>
<li><a href="https://short.therealadam.com">This blog</a> (<a href="https://short.therealadam.com/feed.xml">RSS</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/adam@short.therealadam.com">@adam@short.therealadam.com</a>), answering “hey Adam, what’s currently intriguing you?”</li>
<li><a href="https://ruby.social/web/@therealadam">Mastodon</a> (<a href="%20https://ruby.social/@therealadam.rss">RSS</a>, @therealadam@ruby.social), answering “hey Adam, tell me your best one-liners and weirdest hot-takes?”</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/therealadam">Twitter</a>, answering “hey Adam, what are you thinking about, but in a punchier format?”</li>

			 <p><a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/the-art-of-sketching-strategies-for-getting-started/">The Art of Sketching: Strategies for Getting Started</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edouard Manet, the French modernist painter, once gave a still-life painting lesson to another French impressionist, Eva Gonzales. His directions for capturing the moment could be taken as instruction for sketching in any creative discipline; “Get it down quickly. Don’t worry about the background. Just go for the tonal values. See?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s about making music (ostensibly with Ableton), but applies to any creative endeavor. Coding, writing, whatever!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sketching with regularity can help you let go of the pressure of perfectionism, and arrive at a place of more casual creativity. Simply start, then sift through your sketches to find the gems later. Raúl Sotomayor has found that aiming for quantity tends to result in quality ideas to build from; “I used to make a beat every morning, spending 10 minutes to an hour, and then go on with my day. That was really helpful, because at the end of a week, I&rsquo;ll have seven beats and most of the time, at least one of them would be useful.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a creative principle, “quantity creates quality” has served me well over the past several years. You can’t create quality if you don’t have 1) a starting point and 2) freedom to throw away the lowest quality 90% of the work!</p>

			 <p>This is a story about a tiny toy table. Well, a couple of them.</p>
<p>Courtney and I play pub quiz, a lot. We play with a regular group of people at a couple of venues across town. We aim to take a “podium place” home. We come up with a fresh, topical team name every week. We are a bit competitive. It’s a thing.</p>
<p>One of our team rules is: avoid second-guessing ourselves<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The first reasonably confident person to provide the answer to our “quiz scribe” holds sway. Typically, they’re right or confident enough that no further discussion is needed and the answer is scribed to the answer sheet. A terrible way to run a company or government, but an okay way to run a quiz team.</p>
<p>Occasionally, it happens, during a quiz, that two folks will feel that the answer to a question <em>must</em> or <em>must not</em> be something. For instance, there are very frequently questions on the numerically outstanding planets in our solar system. It’s almost always Jupiter or Saturn, but it’s hard to say which. “It’s Jupiter because it has a ton of moons” or “it <em>can’t</em> be Jupiter because Saturn has even more moons”! Well, given the no-second-guessing rule, now we have a pickle. Two conflicting answers, or a non-answer, and what to do about it?</p>
<p>Regardless of how we arrive at it, we can only write one answer. This leaves the door open for us to <em>have</em> the right answer, but <em>write down</em> the wrong answer. Little indignations in jest. We are a bit competitive.</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-flipping-table">Enter the flipping table</h2>
<p>Possibly, you’ve seen the table-flip “emoji”: (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻. It’s a shorthand for “this makes me have a big, not-good feeling” in online conversation. If not, here’s the late, great Alan Rickman “performing it”:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7748/2022/2c7201e19d.gif" alt="Alan Rickman turning a table over"></p>
<p>That’s how it feels when you suggested the right answer and your quiz team went with the wrong answer anyway. <em>Actually</em> flipping tables would get us kicked out and banned from the venues we frequent, so that’s not an option. However, it happens, tables come in <em>all</em> sizes. Including, very tiny simulacrum of tables.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7748/2022/1d12a90c23.png" alt="This is a toy, not an actual dining set"></p>
<p>So one night after quiz, I scoured the internet for tiny tables that we could flip. Once I dialed in the search (there are many ways to search for “toy table” on Amazon that will not yield tables that are toys or tables that are flippable amongst polite company), a table was ordered. A few days later, thanks to the magic of just-in-time supply chain logistics<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, we had a toy table. So it came that every night, as we were preparing for the quiz, we set out our little (toy) table on top of the (actual) table in case there was a moment of indignation.</p>
<h2 id="our-reputation-precedes-us">Our reputation precedes us</h2>
<p>Turns out, flipping a tiny table with your finger is pretty cathartic. The tiny table got a lot of use. We really liked our tiny table.</p>
<p>Even better, a table of adults with a tiny toy table in the center of them is a curious thing. Other teams and quiz hosts inquired about our table. We explained it, let them flip the table. People liked it.</p>
<p>Word of our flipping table spread amongst the Austin pub-quiz community. When new hosts would fill in for our normal quiz host, they would introduce themselves and ask to see our flipping table.</p>
<p>Our reputation for flipping tables preceded us. One could have a worse reputation!</p>
<h2 id="epilogue-for-a-tiny-toy-table">Epilogue for a tiny toy table</h2>
<p>As is common of tiny toys delivered by a logistics machine optimized for low cost, the flipping table was not particularly strong. Eventually, we lost or broke it, I don’t remember which.</p>
<p>In any case, a second, slightly larger and fancier flipping table was provisioned. This one even had place settings. Fast-forward a few months, it too broke. One of our quiz teammates took it upon themselves to <em>repair</em> said table. At this point, we had a very robust flipping table, and <em>some</em> of its place settings remaining.</p>
<p>Sadly, our regular quizzing was curtailed by the pandemic, shutting down basically all bars wherein one would play pub quiz. I’m not sure where the flipping table ended up; we haven’t used it in the year since we started quizzing again.</p>
<p>But those months we had a flipping table; glory days!</p>

<p>Hayes Carll is my favorite under-the-radar, “this is what country music should sound like” musician. Wit, remorse, nostalgia. Storytelling, quirky characters, relatable characters. Little bit of rock, little bit of western. An ideal Americana mix. It’s all there.</p>
<p>Plus, at 40 minutes, it’s a perfect road trip selection. Always moving forward, but never long-winded.</p>

			 <p>I jumped into a short <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1561504734892023808">un-conference organized/hosted by Andy Matuschak</a> last weekend. Within this humble Gather, I came across lots of intriguing people and energizing ideas. Some notes and a few follow-up ideas:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/7748/2022/e1baddc3b8.png" alt="My notes from the event"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.napkin.one">Napkin</a> is <em>space</em> for ideas and not, it seems, about note capture as an end. Rather, it&rsquo;s about throwing ideas or quotes at the (metaphorical) wall and letting the system organize them into clusters or connections. If you like some of those idea, you organize the ideas into a linear outline and export that to whatever you like to write with.</p>
<p><a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/">Nutshell</a> is about adding an extra dimension to documents on the web. The creator, <a href="https://ncase.me">Nicky Case</a>, described it as a &ldquo;tool for expandable explanation&rdquo;. Those explanations take the form of popovers that may contain a bit of text (like a footnote/annotation), a scraped reference to another page (transclusion), or a fully interactive gizmo to explore an idea in a more tactile manner.</p>
<p>Excitement about applying language models (e.g. GPT-3 or DALL-E) to generative creativity came up a few times. Some of the applications demoed were already using language models to augment insight or obviate manual human organization. Using models to &lsquo;read between the lines&rsquo; of captured notes/human input and generate new ideas came up as well.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with some current PKM tools came up a couple times. In particular, seeking note capture or memory recall as a (customer) engagement end rather than as a means to thinking more/better thoughts. I <em>think</em> I heard a couple criticisms that some tool was &ldquo;too IT&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m not sure I even heard it correctly or what that would even mean! 😆</p>
<p>Overall: highly recommend seeking folks using computers to augment their ability to create and remember instead of stopping at “finally got my notes app just the way I like it”!</p>

			 <p>About a year ago, I added a curiously pretentious object to my repertoire of productivity hacks. <a href="https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog">Analog</a> is a) a paper productivity notation not unlike Bullet Journaling b) printed on pleasantly thick index cards and c) a bit of desk furniture to prop up the cards and store the last couple dozen of them.</p>
<p>The idea is you write your tasks down for today/later/someday. Those tasks sit right in front of you, taunting you. You cross them off as you get stuff done. Now you’ve done a productivity!</p>
<p>Reductionist jokes aside, it’s a fine system. The cards are printed with “Today”, “Next”, or “Someday” at the top and lines to encourage writing down several, but not too many, tasks. It’s a good way to think about organizing what you need/want to get done. As productivity systems go, it’s clear and non-invasive<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/02/one-month-on-analog/">Dave Rupert uses/tried Analog</a> too and has a good take on it.</p>
<p>Tactility is Analog’s leg up. It’s nice to start the day writing out some tasks, looking over the previous day’s cards, shuffling the cards from previous days. Even <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things, the best task software</a>, can’t provide the tactile “ahhhh”-moment of crossing an item off your list. Tasteful animation, design, and haptics get close, but touching glass isn’t as good as pen and paper.</p>
<p>That said, I’m not tempted to discard Things. It’s literally one of the best applications I’ve used, ever. That said, it’s charming to have a redundant, back-up scheme for reminding myself of the most important things to accomplish today. Analog is like having a (very handsome) back-up alarm clock to the alarm clock one <em>intends</em> to wake up to. It’s always pleasant to look at, and every so often it is the difference between an energetic day and a day played catching up.</p>

			 <p>This ended up covering late Davis stuff. He’s basically inventing a new genre of jazz every album or two now.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On the Corner</em>: Davis invents funk/soul jazz.</li>
<li><em>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</em>: Davis invents rock/jazz fusion.</li>
<li><em>Tutu</em>: Davis invents synth-jazz/the thing that would get distilled and warped down to New Age/Kenny G jazz in the 90s.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous live albums! I didn’t go down the rabbit hole on this part. <em>Miles and Quincy Live at Montreux</em> features Quincy Jones and is a pretty great end-of-career retrospective.</p>
<p>“Willie Nelson” on <em>Directions</em> is surprisingly funky.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, I could have gone for less <em>Birth of the Cool</em>-esque and more <em>Bitches Brew</em>. 🤷I like bop, but funk and fusion are more legible to my modest jazz-harmony ear.</p>
<p>Highlights: <em>On the Corner</em>, <em>Jack Johnson</em>, <em>Tutu</em>. The last was originally planned as a Miles Davis/Prince collaboration (❗ ❗ ❗) which fell through. Still pretty good.</p>
<p>What I’d hoped to get out of this, and indeed did, was hearing the invention of large swaths of the jazz landscape over time, album by album. In this way, Miles Davis was a singular influence on the course of music, a lot like Beethoven was.</p>
<p>Hopefully, in my lifetime, we’ll realize another musician has come around and broadly invented entire genres of music every few albums. (I’m assuming we’ll still have albums!)</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.rabbitholeathon.com">Rabbit-hole-athon</a> - it doesn’t look like an event is scheduled, but I dig the idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tl;dr, we are organizing a weekend long IRL rabbit-hole-athon for technologists: an intimate retreat/hackathon dedicated to reading, thinking deeply about a topic, and sharing your learnings with others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like a hackathon or BarCamp, but with the intent to <em>focus</em> an individual&rsquo;s attention on a topic of their choosing instead of <em>diffusing</em> it. (Which is fine, on balance!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that being a good builder and problem solver is rooted in being a clear thinker. Intentionally dedicating time to exploring, pursuing your curiosity, and understanding things deeply is an important part of exercising this muscle. We believe this is essential in shaping the next generation of technologists, builders, founders, and researchers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a snappy manifesto! The notion of taking an afternoon/day/weekend to throw tactics to the wind and go deep on a topic is exciting. I’m already thinking about topics I could go down the rabbit hole on. 🧠</p>

			 <p>I saw this local band Adam’s Farm (no relation, promise) a few times when I was 15 or so. In the era of mixing bass guitar <em>out</em> of rock music (no thanks, Metallica), these fellows stood out by being having an EP where I could clearly hear <em>all</em> the instruments. It was almost 25 years later that I’d learn that “Girlfriend” in particular is a Modern Lovers cover.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sidenote: it seemed like this local band was lost to the internet until recently as well. I figured I’d ripped one of the only copies of this CD, but Adam’s Farm music appeared on YouTube recently. Fancy that!</p>
<p>William Shatner’s cover of “Common People” is less difficult to find, but possibly equally obscure. Back in the late ’90s, Shatner did some voice overs on a Ben Folds pre-solo album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_Pop"><em>Fear of Pop</em></a>. In the mid ‘00s, Folds produced William Shatner’s album of songs with tons of guests doing the singing and Shatner mostly <em>talking</em> about mortality and aging. Again, it was several years before I heard the original of “Common People”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I rather like these two covers better than the originals. So it goes with a notable cover!</p>

			 <p>The modern marvel that moves commodities, sub-assemblies, finished product, and people across the planet is largely invisible. Except when I’m bumped from an overbooked flight. Or when I can’t buy your favorite kind of candy because the trucks to move the containers from the ships to the stores are in the wrong place. Or when one can’t build a car in Germany because semiconductor fabrication plants aren’t as elastic as some executive thought they were. Then it becomes all too apparent that the default state of transportation is, absent considerable effort and coordination, for the wheels to fly off constantly.</p>
<p>Hence, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PHmYhE4sKnwzYgvkh/a-brief-introduction-to-container-logistics">A Brief Introduction to Container Logistics</a> is a great primer for understanding the weird state of our world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole shipping process involves dozens of actors, from the exporter, through a long chain of companies who handle the container (incurring costs on behalf of the shipment), all the way to the importer. This creates a trust problem: who is responsible for the problems that arise when one part of this chain goes wrong? Some of these companies are hired by the shipping company, others by the exporter or importer, or even by a logistics company acting as a middle man. This is usually solved by some kind of chain of custody, where any problem with the container must be immediately noted and complained about by the relevant party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adjacent: Venkatesh Rao, <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/remystifying-supply-chains">Remystifying Supply Chains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supply chains are a new class of engineered-emergent artifact, one that includes a few other globe-spanning things like the internet, the air travel system, and low earth orbit, that exist at a level of Gaian phenomenology, terraforming, and planet-scale husbandry. We only ever catch local glimpses of these things. The wholes are too big to fit in a single human mind, and the physical embodiments are too vast to capture even on a single map, let alone in a single photograph.</p>
<p>We have to understand these beasts, in all their evolving, learning glory, while living within their bellies. Abstract slicing and dicing of the phenomenology, via aspects like computation, circularity, and situatedness, can only get us so far. To finish the picture, we have to develop a sensitivity to how we inhabit these beasts at a human scale.</p>

			 <p>Fancy some near-term imagination on the opportunities the re-commercialization of space presents us? Yes, have some! <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/11/17/science-upside-for-starship/">Science upside for Starship</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, however, a fun exercise to enumerate all the ways in which Starship and related technologies can help execute bold, ambitious missions of scientific discovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giant, poly-lithic space telescopes? Sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably the coolest telescope concept enabled by Starship, though, is the giant segmented telescope to end all giant segmented telescopes. An unmodified Starship can deliver perhaps a dozen 8 m monolithic hexagonal free-flying segments per launch to a target location such as L2, where they self assemble, calibrate, and then focus incoming light. Over a few dozen Starship flights, a truly enormous spherical mirror section perhaps 1000 m in diameter and with a focal length of 1000 km or so can be assembled behind a free-flying sun shade, pointed in a direction of general interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heating (low-key terraforming) Mars with constellations of mirrors? Okay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second is mass producing light sails on Earth, launching them into LEO, then flying them to Mars where they can lurk near Mars-Sun L2 and reflect light back at the planet, reducing heat loss during the Martian night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Flood the zone” of our planetary neighbors with exploratory robots? As you wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why shouldn’t we have a dedicated orbiter, lander, rover, helicopter, and submarine on every discrete body in the solar system over, say, 100 km in diameter? Let’s build a fleet of clockwork automatons for Venus and an armada of submarines for Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Let’s darken the Martian skies with helicopters. Let’s drive rovers across the frozen nitrogen plains of Pluto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure it’s a lot more complicated than it sounds from these pull-quotes. I’ll bet that SpaceX’s starship won’t meet some of these expectations. We will have to hold our nose or plug our ears as Musk bloviates. Despite all that, it’s exciting that folks are thinking, writing, and blogging about this and <em>some</em> of it could come to fruition in my lifetime!</p>

<p>Favorite tracks: “Suck My Kiss”, “Sir Psychosexy”, “Power of Equality”, “The Righteous &amp; the Wicked”.</p>
<p>The essential (in my opinion) Red Hot Chili Peppers album is, for me, a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the first albums I heard with good bass playing (I ‘grew up’ in the age after Metallica had mixed bass guitar entirely out of their albums and many others followed suit)</li>
<li>One of the first albums I heard that was <em>great</em> from end to end and where many of the songs flowed into each other as if played live, meant to fit together, or like they weren’t even separate songs</li>
<li>Extremely teenage and horny, of which I was both when I first heard it</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s an album that has aged well for me. It was an excellent album when I first heard it, and is <em>still</em> an excellent album when I listen to it today.</p>
<p>There are other nice qualities too: Rick Rubin’s production work. When it’s not extremely horny, it has some good lyrics. It’s rooted in the RHCP musical predecessors with intelligent awareness, not than blind copying. They are seeing further by standing on the shoulders of George Clinton, not just sitting on his shoulders for a free ride. It’s just good funk.</p>
<p>And yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnvpU0d7vyM">the RHCP joke in <em>The Good Place</em> is superb</a>.</p>

			 <p>Kevin Kelly, <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-third-way/">The Third Way</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huge monopolistic companies running platforms like Facebook and Amazon are not mere corporations, nor are they governments, even though they have many of the attributes of both government and corporations. They are a new third thing: platforms. We should not expect to regulate platforms like companies, nor expect them to behave like governments. We need a third category of rights and responsibilities for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Platform-principalities. Bank-states (which, oddly enough, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUduBmvQ_4">includes airlines</a>). Energy-sovereigns (British Petroleum, Exxon). Media-empires (Disney, Universal).</p>
<p>We require a better term for companies that have grown so extraordinarily. Those like Apple that run international diplomacy programs with China. Those like Amazon or Google, that regard their employees as de-facto citizens. Those like airlines that can print a currency (in the form of loyalty programs).</p>
<p>And, as Kelly notes, we should look at them in an entirely different way. We shouldn’t treat Amazon the same we treat a local retailer, just like we don’t treat your local HOA the same way we treat the European Union. “Platforms” is a good start, but a word that connects the tremendous influence modern mega-corps have with the power that Standard Oil or The British East India Corporation had at their apex would be even better!</p>

<p><em>Endtroducing</em> is my canonical example of a revealing album. I heard “Building Steam With a Grain of Sand” completely accidentally in a college business writing class, of all places. A fellow student used it in their presentation, ironically. Afterwards, I asked “what <em>was</em> that?!”, my mind still blown.</p>
<p>I downloaded it and was immediately like “wow”. A whole new angle on music became apparent. I was vaguely aware that hip-hop quotes other music, but didn’t really understand sampling. I’m <em>just</em> old enough that hip-hop has always been a thing. But this was so different, like an other-worldly quote-fest. But, in a good way. A great way, even.</p>
<p>I later learned <em>Endtroducing</em> is notable in that it was made <em>manually</em>. Ableton didn’t exist, so if you wanted to change tempos on samples, you had to pitch correct them yourself. You didn’t have to tape splice anymore, thankfully. But it was still far tricker than making this album would have been today.</p>
<p>This album would spark many musical explorations. Mash-ups like <em>A Night at the Hip-Hopera</em>. The Roots, J Dilla, Soulquarians, and a myriad of other artists. “Building Steam With a Grain of Sand” sparked amazement, curiosity, and appetite for more music I was previously unaware of.</p>

<p>These are my favorite of Beethoven’s “more approachable” symphonies. Symphony No. 9 is my favorite, but it requires a bit more context to take in. Further, it’s a solid seventy minutes of music, ramping up the difficulty of attention span.</p>
<p>Symphony No. 7 (hereafter Seven, etc.) is my favorite outside of Nine, which is sort of its own <em>pivotal</em> thing. It’s a definitive no-skip symphony. Every movement is sublime in its own way. The first movement for its vigor and speed. The second for its solemn opening that builds and builds into a big, emotional moment. The third for its frolic. The final movement for feeling several minutes of emphatic, resolving punctuation and resolution.</p>
<p>Symphony No. 8 has a wonderful opening. The structure and melodic quality is closer to what came <em>before</em> Beethoven’s Symphony No. 1. It sounds like a nod back to Haydn or Mozart, Beethoven’s predecessors. But the harmony and orchestration is distinctly of Beethoven. It’s a great bridge from Beethoven’s Very Good symphonies to his <em>Amazing Symphony Number 9, The One with Ode to Joy</em> (not the official title as recognized by music historians).</p>
<p>These two symphonies fit together <em>really well</em> on CDs. So, you can find basically any conductor/ensemble you prefer performing it. I listened to the Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic version when I was playing music in high school. I’ve found this piece easy to hear little variations between conductors, so if that’s your thing, queue up a few interpretations and go hunting for little distinctions!</p>

			 <p>There are four-ish kinds of great albums, in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pivotal albums: the artist or genre was distinctly different before and after the album came out. e.g., classical music was distinctly different after Beethoven, particularly <em>Symphony No. 9</em></li>
<li>Revealing albums: pivotal to my perspective or knowledge of music. e.g., my understanding of hip-hop was distinctly different after I heard DJ Shadow’s <em>Endtroducing</em></li>
<li>Consistent albums: no track justifies skipping, you can listen to the thing end to end, every time. e.g., Tom Petty’s <em>The Last DJ</em></li>
<li>Under-rated albums: albums that are outshined by their extraordinary peers or contemporaries. Most folks know that <em>Born to Run</em> is great, and all other Springsteen albums (generally) rank below it. But that shouldn’t let otherwise excellent and out-of-sequence later albums like <em>The Rising</em> or <em>Human Touch</em> go unnoticed.</li>

			 <p>I’m kicking off a new “listening project” - Miles Davis. Inspired by <a href="https://samenright.com/2021/06/06/a-beginners-guide-to-miles-davis/">A Beginner’s Guide to Miles Davis</a>, I’m going to grind my way through the Miles-verse in chronological order. For posterity, my favorites from before this journey are <em>Sketches of Spain</em> and <em>Bitches Brew</em>.</p>
<p>(I think <em>Kind of Blue</em> is properly rated but not noteworthy because it’s the jazz album that everyone knows and reveres, whether they like jazz or not. And, rightly so.)</p>
<p>Previously in listening projects:</p>
<p>Circa 2008, I got a little bored/annoyed with what I was listening to and decided to play through all the songs in my iTunes library, in order by artist. Discoveries (to me) lurking therein: Bruce Springsteen <em>Born to Run</em>, Talking Heads, <em>Stop Making Sense</em>. Getting through the B-artists was a real endeavor. I have a <em>lot</em> of Ben Folds, Beethoven, Billy Joel, and Brahms albums.</p>
<p>Circa 2016, I listened to all of the Radiohead albums in chronological order. I’d previously really only known them as “the Creep guys” and “the dudes who released an album of MP3s way before everyone else”. (But probably not before Prince, who also performed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAzzRQe6lms">“Creep”</a>, eventually.)</p>

<p>Computer architecture, Verilog code to implement the design, simulation and testing of the design, writing an assembler and assembly to test the system. All within my favorite kind of constraint - fitting each component on one page.</p>
<p>They’re not particularly useful machines, but they do de-mystify the bridge from electrical engineering to software engineering.</p>
<p>When I was an intern at Texas Instruments, the tools for this were enormously complex, slow, and expensive. Whole clusters of Sun machines set aside for simulating the upcoming designs and verifying they did the right thing in software. Not to mention the tremendous effort of verifying the design that was coded was possible to build in the company’s chip fabrication plants and processes.</p>
<p>That this depth of tooling is now available to hobbyists would have blown me away in 2002.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s hard to land music, books, etc. recommendations from friends because timing is everything. The best case is a recommendation for a thing I didn&rsquo;t know of and it&rsquo;s <em>precisely</em> what I need to read or watch at the exact moment. Beyond that, it&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;m reading some 900-page book (humble-brag) or deep into a peak television series (humble-brag) that I&rsquo;m trying to finish before my attention wanders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come up with a couple of ways to more immediately act on recommendations, so they aren&rsquo;t for naught:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a Kindle/iBooks sample right away and read the first several pages of whatever they recommended. If I&rsquo;m into it maybe I&rsquo;ll stick with it. At least, it&rsquo;s on my backlog of books until I forgot why it&rsquo;s there and delete it (i.e., 2-3 times a decade).</li>
<li>Watch the first several minutes of the thing on Netflix or whatever. See if it&rsquo;s any good instead of watching random YouTube videos recommended by the algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>For everything else, there&rsquo;s always the long, scary list of things I&rsquo;d read/watch/play/listen to if we stopped doing billionaires and gave everyone a living wage. 🤷‍♂️</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got three &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; desktops going on my Mac right now. The idea each is its own functional workspace. I don&rsquo;t have three separate physical workspaces to do my writing/thinking, coding/building, or communicating/collaborating. So a digital approximation is the second closest thing. 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>Leftmost is where I do the thinking. The background is one of the &ldquo;scenic&rdquo; images included in macOS. The idea is, if I had a little writing hut, ala <a href="https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/11/06/dickinson/dickinson-thoreau.w700.h467.jpg">Thoreau in <em>Dickinson</em></a> for looking off into the distance and plying some kind of writing craft, this is the kind of thing I would see when I look up.</p>
<p>Rightmost is where I communicate with the world and my colleagues. The background is also a built-in macOS dynamic desktop of swoopy, abstract colors. Like <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oliver-1-1024x576.jpg">John Oliver comes to our living room from a featureless void</a>, so I think of this desktop. Ideas, questions, and data points come to me from the void of the internet, end up in this imagined space, and I respond to them in turn through this medium and back to the void. Heavy, eh?</p>
<p>In the middle is where I do the building and coding. The background here is a flat color. I got it by color picking a photo of the <a href="http://www.12-gaugegarage.com">12-Gauge Garage</a>. I noticed later that it&rsquo;s close to &ldquo;<a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2021/04/disney-go-away-green-lp1/">go away green</a>&rdquo; as used in Disney&rsquo;s theme parks to draw the eye away from backstage areas where the magic may be in-progress or under-repair. The idea is I shouldn&rsquo;t really see this background. I should focus on whatever I&rsquo;m coding/testing/making/etc.</p>

			 <p>Shawn Wang&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.swyx.io/35-principles/">35 Principles for 35 Years</a> are a good read. A few of my favorites:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Seek First To Understand, Then To Be Understood. Don&rsquo;t get defensive about your point of view or perception of reality - understand theirs first. Either you will learn something new or you&rsquo;ll understand how to better get your point across. Hold multiple perspectives in your head and be able to summarize the best arguments of all major parties in a way that THEY agree with.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="15">
<li>Don&rsquo;t offer unsolicited help. Make Sure Help Is Wanted Before Offering It. Men - be especially wary about this when women are talking about their problems. Sometimes they just need support, not solutions.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="23">
<li>Separate Your Identity from Your Work. You can learn a lot on the Internet for the low, low price of $YOUR_EGO.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

		<a href="https://short.therealadam.com/2021/03/27/the-long-game.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-03-27 16:10:35 -0600">Mar 27, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>You can do a lot of fancy stuff with your notes these days. Backlinks, graphs, embedding, “transclusion”, knowledge databases, and digital gardens are all tempting sirens. But <strong>building up a collection of ideas over time and ease of search is the most important thing.</strong></p>
<p>Matt Webb, <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2021/02/10/reservoirs">Memexes, mountain lakes, and the serendipity of old ideas</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve noticed that smart people keep notes, and in particular use their notes in a certain way, and it made me think of something I read recently about viruses.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And it’s interesting, right, this accretive note-taking and the process of taking core samples through the deep time of your own ideas. I’ve built something similar, not as consistently, but for about two decades too, and I keep all my notes in plain text, and all in the same searchable database. I develop nascent ideas in part by typing in keywords, spelunking my own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">memex</a> for things I’ve previously spotted, connections I’ve made, turns of phrase… most of which I had forgotten, but there they are. And old ideas come back and get recombined and become fresh again. That database of notes is my greatest asset. It’s how I write here, and it’s also how I pretend to be clever when I’m working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The endgame of having extensive notes accumulated over a long period of time is not to put them in a grand, unified theory. <strong>The point is to play the long-game to think in them, search them for new insights, and to develop ideas over weeks and months. An antidote to thinking in Slack messages and tweet-storm hot-takes.</strong></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>How Product Hunt does asynchronous work: everyone in their own swimlane, unblocked. I really dig how they haven’t siloed work between front-end/back-end developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.rstankov.com/collaborative-single-player-mode/">Collaborative Single Player Mode</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A developer should be able to execute a feature from start to finish &ndash; from the database to the backend, API, frontend, and CSS. The goal is never to get blocked.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are missing a design, mock the UI, designers can fill this in later</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t know how to do something technically, hack it or fake it</li>
<li>If a product decision is missing, try to make this decision yourself - it&rsquo;s better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like they use feature flags so they can move quickly and decisively, but safely. And of course, plenty of testing and code review automation.</p>

<p>For most of “Starship Troopers,” humanity, in every possible facet, gets its ass kicked. A culture that reveres and communicates exclusively through violence—a culture very much like one that responds to peaceful protests with indiscriminate police brutality, or whose pandemic strategy is to “dominate” an unreasoning virus—keeps running up against its own self-imposed limitations.</p>

<p>The pandemic that has dominated the past three months strikes a useful contrast with what’s happening now. Unlike coronavirus, racism and police violence are problems caused by humans. There’s a saying, “You aren’t stuck in traffic, you are traffic.” Similarly, the unrest occurring right now isn’t something that is happening to anyone, but a phenomenon that everyone is a part of, even if they haven’t left home or directly participated at all. Like traffic, the reason you’re surrounded by protests is partially because of you, regardless of your perceived level of involvement.</p>

			 <p>Bonus quote from <a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/eno/">Revenge of the Intuitive</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years ago I realized that the recording studio was becoming a musical instrument. I even lectured about it, proclaiming that “by turning sound into malleable material, studios invite you to construct new worlds of sounds as painters construct worlds of form and color.” I was thrilled at how people were using studios to make music that otherwise simply could not exist. Studios opened up possibilities. But now I’m struck by the insidious, computer-driven tendency to take things out of the domain of muscular activity and put them into the domain of mental activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am, in general, a sucker for the notion of the studio as a kind of musical instrument unto itself. It&rsquo;s a very maximalist, Romantic-era symphony sort of thinking. I want to be <em>Pet Sounds</em>-era Brian Wilson or <em>Rite of Spring</em>-era Stravinksy when I grow up.</p>

			 <p>We should use the pandemic to reevaluate how we value service, child care, and education labor. It’s apparent we undervalued them. Their value is now explicit for those clamoring for a return to paying people to handle their chores and obligations. So let’s pay them more when we emerge from this!</p>
<p>The burden of navigating urban sprawl to reach our offices, shops, and entertainment is now explicit. Density won’t be the answer for this is in the short or medium term. Perhaps we could value the ease by which we can drive around right now and work backwards from there.</p>
<p>The bit that has worried me is how density is no longer a virtue. Public transport and dense neighborhoods won’t be desirable for a while. What’s the alternative that reduces our environmental toll and increases the cohesion of our neighborhoods?</p>

			 <p>Drew Austin on high/low-brow music, how it fits into album reviews and club culture, and how all that has shifted in our current state of distance. <a href="https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/122-energy-flash">Energy Flash</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For Reynolds, “at home and at album length” refers to a process of decontextualization, the musical equivalent of the modern gallery’s white cube: a belief that any cultural product meriting serious appreciation must prove that it can survive outside of its native habitat by becoming a fungible unit of culture, fitting into the standardized format of Pitchfork album reviews and solitary, focused listening. If music sounds good in a packed nightclub at 3 a.m. but not through headphones on your couch, is it real in the same way that Kid A is real? Right now in quarantine, the contextualizing environments in which culture traditionally incubates are closed off and dormant, so everything has to sound good in the living room whether it’s meant to or not. We live in the white cube now; anything that relies on a specific source of external context is an endangered species. We’re one month into a worldwide experiment to learn whether the internet alone can produce sufficient meaning on its own, or whether we must keep mining our memories of an embodied shared reality to bridge this gap.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The aerospace giant of course wants a $60 billion bailout. Financial problems for this corporation predated the crisis, with the mismanagement that led to the 737 Max as well as defense and space products that don&rsquo;t work (I noted last July a bailout was coming). The corporation paid out $65 billion in stock buybacks and dividends over the last ten years, and it was drawing down credit lines before this crisis hit. It is highly politically connected; the board of the corporation includes Caroline Kennedy, Ronald Reagan’s Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein, three Fortune 100 CEOs, a former US Trade Representative, and two Admirals, one of whom is the board’s only engineer. Using the excuse of the coronavirus, Boeing is trying to get the taxpayer to foot the bill for its errors, so it can go back to making more of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have locality when you don&rsquo;t have to look beyond your gaze to understand how you are affected or how you affect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find languages with a strong module system (Rust, Clojure, sometimes ES6-by-the-books) make each source file more coherent and easier to read than languages where methods or state have more sophisticated/powerful lookup schemes (Ruby, React-flavored ES6).</p>
<p>Plus, strong module systems seem to come with the side benefit of encouraging us to make up names for the functions and state we import, again improving coherence and readability.</p>
<p>A strong sense of locality, module systems, and coherence aren&rsquo;t in a causal relationship, but they sure do taste great together.</p>

			 <p>I often say that learning test-driven development is comparable to learning a whole other programming language. The practice of TDD is a mirror world of depth and trade-offs. Kent Beck underscores that depth in listing all [the desirable qualities of good tests], some of which are at tension with each other. Tests aren’t the easiest thing to get right, but there’s no better way to improve your design skills than to wrestle with the feedback loop of writing tests for the code you’re currently working on.</p>

			 <p>Partial explanation for smart folks, like Paul Graham or Mark Zuckerberg, making consistently bad predictions - <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/how-to-predict-the-future/588040/">The Peculiar Blindness of Experts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Tetlock’s 20-year study, both the broad foxes and the narrow hedgehogs were quick to let a successful prediction reinforce their beliefs. But when an outcome took them by surprise, foxes were much more likely to adjust their ideas. Hedgehogs barely budged. Some made authoritative predictions that turned out to be wildly wrong—then updated their theories in the wrong direction. They became even more convinced of the original beliefs that had led them astray. The best forecasters, by contrast, view their own ideas as hypotheses in need of testing. If they make a bet and lose, they embrace the logic of a loss just as they would the reinforcement of a win. This is called, in a word, learning.</p>

			 <p>Stephen Anderson on <a href="https://medium.com/@stephenanderson/the-future-of-design-computation-complexity-a434d2da3cd5">The Future of Design: Computation &amp; Complexity</a>. Like everything else, its going to get more weird. But, the large-scale outcome remains the same - design is deciding which elements are essential and which elements to remove:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real world isn’t so simple, and often has many competing goals and constraints. As a designer, what are you already doing, to help define the objectives and goals for a project? As critical as this is to teamwork, it’s the single, driving factor for machines. We can — and should — absolutely lean into defining these things. This has always been important, but will be vital as we hand over more decisions to Machine Learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definitely sounds like the future…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, what if I told you nothing could be designed that can’t be pitched, coded up, and released in an afternoon. Sound insane? I know of at least one company — the largest in their industry — that works this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and we have to invent a future where we solve this future we created without thinking through the ramifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never before has technology allowed individuals to do more harm (or good) with such low effort.
— Christian Beck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​Any practice where we can drive the iteration time to zero will end up requiring a new way of working where the computer generates a bunch of possible designs/systems/artifacts and a human applies education and intuition to determine which one to keep:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play this out, and the role of human shifts from that of hands-on creator using software to render an idea to that of a conductor (or curator or cultivator?) working with software to explore possible options. In a sense, we develop a sort of symbiotic relationship with the machine; the machine generates possibilities that we then direct or tweak until arriving at an optimal solution. We see this playing out in nearly every industry, from manufacturing to the design of web sites to healthcare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​A phase transition has already happened where the most successful systems occasionally touch the lives of city-sized populations. “Scale” means the most successful systems/platforms touch entire societies and a major fraction of the human population. I missed this forest amongst the trees of frameworks, languages, and databases. I suspect leaders like Zuckerberg and Dorsey missed it amongst the trees of growth and market acquisition.</p>
<p>Again, we have to invent a future where we fix the future we accidentally created:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is new in all this is visibility into the scale and scope of problems we now work on — we have to ask questions about impact and outcomes. Facebook and Twitter are platforms that have changed the world. The addictive properties of Pinterest and SnapChat are changing human behavior and social interactions. We can’t treat these things like simple web apps. They aren’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of inventing the future to fix the future is thinking more about feedback loops and how small changes in forces and incentives create outsized results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the literature on formal systems thinking is dedicated to this topic of small changes. Reinforcing loops and balancing loops are the two foundational structures of systems thinking. The idea goes like this: Want to introduce a change? Don’t try to change the system (you can’t!). Instead, introduce a small change, or tweak an existing rule, then see what happens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More optimiscally, this last bit leads me to (continue to) think that the skills designers need aren’t so far off the skills developers need:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve identified about 11 ways of being that describe design. I won’t go into them all — there’s a post coming for that. But you’ve heard me mention some of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame &amp; Reframe Problems</li>
<li>Work from Principles &amp; Values</li>
<li>Think in Systems and Contexts</li>
<li>Focus on Human Needs &amp; Motivations</li>
<li>See Possible Futures (where Others See Present Realities)</li>
<li>Thrive on Ambiguity</li>
</ul>

<p>Related related: what if frameworks like Rails, Django, etc. are scaffolds that we attach boilerplate-ish behavior to while we’re trying to figure what a program <em>really</em> wants to be? How many essay-sized programs are hiding in novel or encyclopedia-sized systems?</p>

<p>My current favorite sort of small victory is to write up what I’ve learned if it doesn’t seem like I’m going to get far enough to commit new code behavior. This happens a fair bit when you’re working with a type checker after years of using a very implicit language.</p>

			 <p>A couple things making me feel more productive lately:</p>
<p><strong>Jot down a theme for the day</strong>: at the beginning or end of the day, I make up some kind of near-platitude to help me focus and get stuff done. Recently: “Hack like a writer”, “Finish like a shipper”, “Focus on code”. They&rsquo;re a bit hustle-y, nearly cringe-y, and function only to get me back on track should I field a bunch of curveballs.</p>
<p><strong>“Sync&quot; written notes to a daily page</strong>: usually after lunch and before I wrap up work for the day, I transcribe any notes/sketches/todos/etc. I wrote down, on pen and paper, to a note (in <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a>). This seems to help me keep a clear head and not get overwhelmed on hectic days.</p>
<p>A couple things that feel right but haven&rsquo;t &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; as habits yet:</p>
<p><strong>Set out clothes for tomorrow before I go to bed</strong>: check the weather, set out what I&rsquo;ll wear tomorrow. I often forget, but when I don&rsquo;t I thank myself the next day.</p>
<p><strong>One big thing, a dozen or so little things</strong>: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll go so far as eschewing a productivity/todo app, but using <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/one-thing/">One Thing</a> as a guideline when organizing my tasks often helps me reduce implausible lists to tractable plans.</p>

			 <p>Pitchfork: <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/talking-heads-remain-in-light/?mbid=social_twitter">Talking Head: <em>Remain in Light</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 1980, the conflict in music between what was thought and what was felt was in full cry. As disco continued to monopolize music you could dance to, rock reached a point of maximum theoretical sincerity. Pink Floyd’s The Wall, possibly the least ironic recording of all time, was the No. 1 album in America for 15 weeks. It was finally unseated by Bob Seger’s Against the Wind, which was knocked out of the top spot by Billy Joel’s Glass Houses. Ostensibly, these were works of deep sentiment. To a generation of punks, though, they were rock at its most bloodless and calculating.
&hellip;
The central insight of Talking Heads—what made them not just weird but exciting and relevant—was that their art-house affectation felt more sincere than a lot of American culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Completely unrelated but somewhat adjacent: the unseen magic trick Bruce Springsteen pulls off, for me, is to thread the needle between sincere storytelling, grandiose maximalism, and bar band raucousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without Afrobeat, though, there is no Remain in Light. The central role of West-African polyrhythms in the album’s sound draws attention to a curious aspect of its longevity. Could a group of white musicians playing Afrobeat be taken sincerely in 2018? Virtually every genre of American music, including punk and especially rock, is taken from black forms. Afrobeat is not African-American, though; it’s straight-up African. The 21st-century sensibility finds something problematic in a band of white art-school types playing West African music. Earlier this year, the Beninese musician Angelique Kidjo released her own version of Remain in Light, which NPR described as “an authentic Afrobeat record” compared to the original. Given how closely Kidjo followed the Talking Heads’ arrangements, this description raises questions about what we mean when we say “authentic.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great review and a pretty good read.</p>

<p>The unanticipated but important memo has a difficult road. It will likely be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this is one of the unexpected challenges of taking on engineering leadership responsibilities. First off, you have to do all the writing things right: use a clear and concise subject, say all the important things up front (probably in bullets!), and develop the important details in thoughtful prose. Even if you nail it there, some people just won&rsquo;t read, retain, and/or care about the information you have conveyed to them.</p>
<p>Hence: Always Be Repeating Yourself. Always.</p>
