				"title": "Dilla Time",
				"content_html": "<p><em>Dilla Time</em> is a great book for music history enthusiasts. If you’re at all interested in hip-hop, music production, or sample culture, it’s a must-read. The references to lesser-known hip-hop are worth the time investment alone.</p>\n<p>I saw a critique of the book saying it is a 200-page book hiding in 400 pages<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. I think <em>Dilla Time</em> justifies its page count in a pleasingly clever way. The book overlays the biography of James Yancey with the innovations of J Dilla in much the same way. Chapters on Yancey and Dilla alternate, taking turns. A little bit about Yancey’s musical life, a little bit about his nonmusical life. Once I realized Dilla’s music was about overlaying ideas at odds and the book was about overlaying the man and the music, I was a little giddy and a lot jealous that I hadn’t thought of something like that.</p>\n<p>The book is basically two story lines: a biography of James Yancey and the story of his musical innovations and influences as J Dilla. The latter is, in a nutshell, a great explanation of how Dilla programmed electronics (drum machines, samplers, etc.) to overlay musical patterns that had not gone together previously.</p>\n<p>Let’s assume it’s safe to say that Stravinsky was the master of (riotously) dissonant harmonies. He put notes that should not go together right on top of each other! In the same way, we’d have to say that J Dilla was the master of wielding time in a way that was not previously accepted in musical rhythm. Stravinsky overlaid perfect fifths (good) and tritones (bad!). Dilla overlaid straight (classical) and swung rhythms (jazz) and even moved notes around the beat, to similar effect.</p>\n<p>The tricky thing about listening to J Dilla, as a modern listener, is that it doesn’t sound as drastic as it did fifteen years ago.

				"content_text": "_Dilla Time_ is a great book for music history enthusiasts. If you’re at all interested in hip-hop, music production, or sample culture, it’s a must-read. The references to lesser-known hip-hop are worth the time investment alone.\n\nI saw a critique of the book saying it is a 200-page book hiding in 400 pages[^1]. I think _Dilla Time_ justifies its page count in a pleasingly clever way. The book overlays the biography of James Yancey with the innovations of J Dilla in much the same way. Chapters on Yancey and Dilla alternate, taking turns. A little bit about Yancey’s musical life, a little bit about his nonmusical life. Once I realized Dilla’s music was about overlaying ideas at odds and the book was about overlaying the man and the music, I was a little giddy and a lot jealous that I hadn’t thought of something like that.\n\nThe book is basically two story lines: a biography of James Yancey and the story of his musical innovations and influences as J Dilla. The latter is, in a nutshell, a great explanation of how Dilla programmed electronics (drum machines, samplers, etc.) to overlay musical patterns that had not gone together previously.\n\nLet’s assume it’s safe to say that Stravinsky was the master of (riotously) dissonant harmonies. He put notes that should not go together right on top of each other! In the same way, we’d have to say that J Dilla was the master of wielding time in a way that was not previously accepted in musical rhythm. Stravinsky overlaid perfect fifths (good) and tritones (bad!). Dilla overlaid straight (classical) and swung rhythms (jazz) and even moved notes around the beat, to similar effect.\n\nThe tricky thing about listening to J Dilla, as a modern listener, is that it doesn’t sound as drastic as it did fifteen years ago. Similarly, Stravinsky doesn’t sound revolutionary to our ears, one hundred years on. They both “just” sound like how music is made these days. _Dilla Time_ does an outstanding job putting his innovations in context and particularly _visualizing_ how his musical constructs stood apart from what came before him.\n\nObviously, I enjoyed this book a lot. Check it out.\n\n\n[^1]:\tTo be fair, most books could stand to lose a third or more of their page count.\n",

I know <em>Bitches Brew</em> is a thing, but where it fits chronologically is the missing piece. Davis entirely switching gears from bop to <em>an entirely different vibe</em> must have been as jarring as <em>Rite of Spring</em> was to Parisans. Favorites so far: <em>Filles De Kilimanjaro</em>, <em>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</em>, <em>On the Corner</em>. <em>In a Silent Way</em> is entirely different from the albums around it in this era, but I like how it&#8217;s basically a long song.</p>\n\n<p>Currently listening: <em>Circle in the Round</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Previously: <a href=\"https://short.therealadam.com/2021/09/11/into-the-milesverse.html\">Into the Miles-verse</a>.</p>\n",

Then it becomes all too apparent that the default state of transportation is, absent considerable effort and coordination, for the wheels to fly off constantly.\n\nHence, [A Brief Introduction to Container Logistics](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PHmYhE4sKnwzYgvkh/a-brief-introduction-to-container-logistics) is a great primer for understanding the weird state of our world:\n\n> The whole shipping process involves dozens of actors, from the exporter, through a long chain of companies who handle the container (incurring costs on behalf of the shipment), all the way to the importer. This creates a trust problem: who is responsible for the problems that arise when one part of this chain goes wrong? Some of these companies are hired by the shipping company, others by the exporter or importer, or even by a logistics company acting as a middle man. This is usually solved by some kind of chain of custody, where any problem with the container must be immediately noted and complained about by the relevant party.\n\nAdjacent: Venkatesh Rao, [Remystifying Supply Chains](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/remystifying-supply-chains):\n\n> Supply chains are a new class of engineered-emergent artifact, one that includes a few other globe-spanning things like the internet, the air travel system, and low earth orbit, that exist at a level of Gaian phenomenology, terraforming, and planet-scale husbandry. We only ever catch local glimpses of these things. The wholes are too big to fit in a single human mind, and the physical embodiments are too vast to capture even on a single map, let alone in a single photograph.\n> \n> We have to understand these beasts, in all their evolving, learning glory, while living within their bellies. Abstract slicing and dicing of the phenomenology, via aspects like computation, circularity, and situatedness, can only get us so far. To finish the picture, we have to develop a sensitivity to how we inhabit these beasts at a human scale.\n\n",

The second for its solemn opening that builds and builds into a big, emotional moment. The third for its frolic. The final movement for feeling several minutes of emphatic, resolving punctuation and resolution.</p>\n<p>Symphony No. 8 has a wonderful opening. The structure and melodic quality is closer to what came <em>before</em> Beethoven’s Symphony No. 1. It sounds like a nod back to Haydn or Mozart, Beethoven’s predecessors. But the harmony and orchestration is distinctly of Beethoven. It’s a great bridge from Beethoven’s Very Good symphonies to his <em>Amazing Symphony Number 9, The One with Ode to Joy</em> (not the official title as recognized by music historians).</p>\n<p>These two symphonies fit together <em>really well</em> on CDs. So, you can find basically any conductor/ensemble you prefer performing it. I listened to the Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic version when I was playing music in high school. I’ve found this piece easy to hear little variations between conductors, so if that’s your thing, queue up a few interpretations and go hunting for little distinctions!</p>\n",

The second for its solemn opening that builds and builds into a big, emotional moment. The third for its frolic. The final movement for feeling several minutes of emphatic, resolving punctuation and resolution.\n\nSymphony No. 8 has a wonderful opening. The structure and melodic quality is closer to what came _before_ Beethoven’s Symphony No. 1. It sounds like a nod back to Haydn or Mozart, Beethoven’s predecessors. But the harmony and orchestration is distinctly of Beethoven. It’s a great bridge from Beethoven’s Very Good symphonies to his _Amazing Symphony Number 9, The One with Ode to Joy_ (not the official title as recognized by music historians).\n\nThese two symphonies fit together _really well_ on CDs. So, you can find basically any conductor/ensemble you prefer performing it. I listened to the Karajan/Berlin Philharmonic version when I was playing music in high school. I’ve found this piece easy to hear little variations between conductors, so if that’s your thing, queue up a few interpretations and go hunting for little distinctions!\n\n",

The idea is, if I had a little writing hut, ala [Thoreau in _Dickinson_](https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/11/06/dickinson/dickinson-thoreau.w700.h467.jpg) for looking off into the distance and plying some kind of writing craft, this is the kind of thing I would see when I look up.\n\nRightmost is where I communicate with the world and my colleagues. The background is also a built-in macOS dynamic desktop of swoopy, abstract colors. Like [John Oliver comes to our living room from a featureless void](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oliver-1-1024x576.jpg), so I think of this desktop. Ideas, questions, and data points come to me from the void of the internet, end up in this imagined space, and I respond to them in turn through this medium and back to the void. Heavy, eh?\n\nIn the middle is where I do the building and coding. The background here is a flat color. I got it by color picking a photo of the [12-Gauge Garage](http://www.12-gaugegarage.com). I noticed later that it's close to \"[go away green](https://insidethemagic.net/2021/04/disney-go-away-green-lp1/)\" as used in Disney's theme parks to draw the eye away from backstage areas where the magic may be in-progress or under-repair. The idea is I shouldn't really see this background. I should focus on whatever I'm coding/testing/making/etc.\n\n\n",

And you know, being a social primate, exactly where you are in the organization relative to that floor. Offices all have their formal and informal maps, whether inside a bank, statehouse, cathedral, museum, school, or open-plan tech firm. I say “West Wing” and you know what I’m talking about. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I once worked at a company where the hypothesis behind customer acquisition was currently in flux. A couple times a quarter, a new concept would come along. With a new concept almost always came a change in the sequencing of handoffs between teams. This month, outside sales hands off to the onboarding team hands off to customer support. The next month, marketing hands off to outside sales hands off to onboarding.</p>\n\n<p>It so happens this company had a large, somewhat raucous open office layout. All of sales, support, and marketing were in one big room. (With three different Sonos systems playing three different songs at any given time. Madness.)</p>\n\n<p>It also so happened that this was a high-energy sales culture. (Are there kinds of sales culture? Someone tell me there are monk-ish sales people, making one call per day, speaking only a few quiet words, ringing a small bell, and going home for the day. 😆)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, when the current concept of how customers were handed off from the top of the funnel downward, a few people would move the desks around so hand-offs happened across aisles of the office and not from one corner of the office to a remote corner sixty feet away.</p>\n\n<p>The upside of all this apparent chaos was that on any given day, you could walk into the office and see the current hypothesis of customer acquisition. As long as you knew who was in sales, marketing, support, etc. or their typical posture (walking around talking on a headset, answering emails as quickly as possible, looking at marketing campaign mockups), you could tell what&#8217;s going on. One could literally walk through the funnel, from marketing to sales to onboarding (assuming that was the hypothesis of the day).</p>\n\n<p>Besides the madness of open offices with multiple songs within speaking distance of each other, I think this is not the worst way to arrange a physical workspace.</p>\n",

In a hurry to record the song &#8220;He&#8217;s a Rebel,&#8221; but unable to cut the song with the vocalists they had under contract, the New York-based group The Crystals, Sill and Spector turned to Love, who lived in Los Angeles. Spector was racing to release his version of the Gene Pitney-penned tune before a version recorded by Vikki Carr could come out and pre-empt his sales. Spector paid Love a flat fee and triple scale to record the song and to allow him to release it under the name The Crystals. The arrangement, made without consulting with The Crystals, was indicative of the power producers had over artists. Describing her experience recording with Spector in her memoir, Love recalled that Spector encouraged what Love calls &#8220;the low, growling side of my voice, the righteous indignation and in-your-face testimony that I usually saved for church.&#8221; Accentuating vocal Blackness in the early 1960s was a daring move in the segregated U.S., but it paid off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I saw Darlene Love perform, oddly enough, at EPCOT Center. I wonder if they offer musicians a big vacation package for that, of it was just a price-is-right situation?</p>\n\n<p>Between songs, she alluded to having worked with Phil Spector. She basically called him out for the shady behavior described in the NPR story. I&#8217;m guessing it was not for the first time. She concluded the retelling of her history by saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if he hears about me saying this! He&#8217;s in jail, can&#8217;t do anything about it!&#8221; 😆</p>\n\n<p>Wall of Sound is one of my favorite maximalist musical styles and all, but I hope Darlene Love is updating her sick burns on (convicted murderer) Phil Spector to end with &#8220;don&#8217;t matter because he&#8217;s dead now!&#8221;</p>\n",

The narrative of “the coastal elites want to tell you what to feel guilty about; we won’t let them” is effective for a reason: because we are collectively guilty of so many things, from climate change to police brutality and everything else. The Trump candidacy figured out how to exploit this better than anyone else: in a complex and interdependent world, everyone is basically guilty of everything. And when that’s true, no one can say “you should feel guilt” without sounding hypocritical. It’s a perfect judo move, because not only does it neutralize the superego’s ability to effectively level any criticism, it opens the door for the ego to go be as offensive as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Before the invention of the telegraph, there was no way to instantaneously synchronize timekeeping devices across long distances. No time zones, no universal standard against which clock towers could be evaluated for accuracy. Timekeeping was more an art than a science. Each village emitted its own time zone. Much like the townships of old, every internet community has its own “subjective time zone”.</p>\n\n<p>The disruption of the old timekeeping regime created a void that’s being filled by new online communities, cliques, and cults. Whereas the industrial schedule provided a sense of structure and stability and continuity, D.I.Y. timekeeping often feels aimless and disorienting and uncertain. People are seeking out groups and ideologies that put them “back in time”, and many internet subcultures do exactly that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Under the hood, there&#8217;s not much to it; you could implement it with a static site generator. By that measure, I might describe this as a &#8220;brochure&#8221; site. But the attention to design and organization makes it feel much more like a product. Delightfully, one that doesn&#8217;t seek a commercial transaction.

Their value is now explicit for those clamoring for a return to paying people to handle their chores and obligations. So let’s pay them more when we emerge from this!\n\nThe burden of navigating urban sprawl to reach our offices, shops, and entertainment is now explicit. Density won’t be the answer for this is in the short or medium term. Perhaps we could value the ease by which we can drive around right now and work backwards from there.\n\nThe bit that has worried me is how density is no longer a virtue. Public transport and dense neighborhoods won’t be desirable for a while. What’s the alternative that reduces our environmental toll and increases the cohesion of our neighborhoods?\n",

But when an outcome took them by surprise, foxes were much more likely to adjust their ideas. Hedgehogs barely budged. Some made authoritative predictions that turned out to be wildly wrong—then updated their theories in the wrong direction.

But when an outcome took them by surprise, foxes were much more likely to adjust their ideas. Hedgehogs barely budged.
